They greeted us warmly and acted like they cared that we were there.  Our service was quick and our needs were taken care of. Very friendly and professional.\nOur meals were OK.  The meat was fine but a bit dried out.  The sweet potato fries were tasteless and lacked any texture.  The slaw had a bit too much vinegar taste.\nWe wanted to see about having them cater a party and were told the manager would have to help us so we asked to see him.  Somehow it was too much trouble for him to even stop by our table and answer our questions.  As a matter of fact he never seemed to visit any of the tables to check on his customers.  I guess hanging out at the bar is his purpose in being there.\nOh well there are a lot of places that value their customers.  We'll just get our barbecue from someone who cares,",

First and foremost....there is no reason to make a reservation because they seem to have a faulty system of recording who calls in to make a reservation.   I made a reservation the day prior however no record of this on their quarter sheet paper written by sharpie marker. \n\nYes, of course I am going to make a reservation on Valentines Day when I have a 4 and 6 year old with me, so if you have lost the reservation then it is rude to act like I am the inconvenience and make me wait 30 minutes  for your incompetence.  \n\nActually one of the gentleman that was our server today was very pleasant.  However there is a female server, who I suspect failed to make the reservation, black hair, slightly overweight, appears to fail to have the facial muscle to smile but is able to provide a facial expression of discontent  who spoke poorly about her own staff members \"if you can't take the heat then get out...\" in front of the customers.  Very classy and obviously unsatisfied with her career choice in life.  She will be the main reason I will defer referring others to this restaurant. \n\nAs for the food, remotely I remember the high tea was good.  The pasta was good, but had a piece of hair we found.  The burger left something to be desired.  The service, the server we had who was young caucasian male was new and seem to be the only one who had a positive attitude.",

It's a small, cozy place away from the busy intersection of Atwater and Notre-Dame. The waitress was very friendly and informed me all the specials that they had for the day.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't get the seafood platter that came with half a lobster, oysters, tataki, sashimi, and other yummy seafood because I was on my own. But I promised to come back for it with my boyfriend.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, I got my Kaisen Don, which is an assorted sashimi with rice. It came with a salad, pickled peppers, and miso soup. The presentation was beautiful. The sashimi wasn't as fresh or thickly sliced as I wanted it to be, but I guess I've been spoiled by Vancouver's sushi. It was also pretty pricey for what it was, $28 plus tax.

I remembered enjoying it a lot so I returned with some family who I thought might enjoy the place. When I arrived I saw the name was different so I assumed it was a different place. Upon closer expectation it looked like it had just been a renaming. The place was pretty empty when we arrived so we ordered pretty quickly. The place looks pretty much the same from the last time I visited. There are many more items on the me\u00f1u now, mostly chinese dishes. I don't like Sushi but my family does so they ordered some. Last time I visited my friend said their sushi was pretty enjoyable. This time around my family was not very impressed and said it was not worth the money they charged. I personally ordered and tried the Combination Chow mein, Honey Walnut Shrimp, spring rolls and Thai Iced Tea. It was all pretty okay too me. The chow mein was a little extra greasy. The shrimp was kind of citrus like but it was very enjoyable. Spring rolls were not my favorite but still good. The tea was not as great as i remember and they drowned it out with lots of ice, so it was gone very quickly. The place reminded me of China A Go Go and I imagine maybe they are following their success. Service was not very good. Besides a loss in translation, they did not seem to want us eating in the restaurant. Despite the many tables and chair, it is mainly not a dine-in location. It's focus now is mainly to go, which is different from the last time I visited. They also had a security guard. While we ate the guard and some of the workers watched a basketball game and cheered often and loudly. This made our visit very unpleasant. Despite all of this I may visit again to try their ramen and give another review. Until next time!",

Due to stringent stipulations on redeeming the coupon, our attempts to use it in time were rebuked and the deal lapsed. We called and asked about redeeming the coupon for its original value and they said it was okay.\n\nFast-forward a few months.  We were downtown running some errands and decided to give the place a shot.  It was early on a Saturday evening, and we sat in the simple shaded patio area on the sidewalk. The drinks looked really nice, so I ordered a signature cocktail. The drink took 15 minutes to prepare, despite the fact that there was only one other table dining.  I was disappointing to find that the drink was poorly mixed, resulting in the flavor of a cucumber liquor eclipsing the delicate mixture of herbs and chartreuse. \n\nFor starters we had the Brie with Jam, which is baked into a puff pastry with a strawberry sliced on the side.  The presentation was nice, aside from being burned onto the dish, and the appetizer was essentially the fanciest Pop Tart I had ever eaten. Not bad, but a bit too sweet for a starter.   \n\nFor a main course we split the shepherd's pie, of which only two are baked per night. Having arrived 30 minutes after they opened, we got there just in time to have the last one! Very exciting.  Again, the plating of the dish was very nice. It was molded into the shape of a small cake, baked in a crust of prosciutto and drowned in brown gravy.  Clawing past the porcine armor with our forks, we found it filled with carrots chopped into mashed potatoes, sitting on a thin layer of hamburger. Not much for $30, but it looked great. Unfortunately, the intense saltiness of the gravy and the prosciutto overshadowed any other flavor that may have existed in the dish. The sodium burned my pallet so badly, that I couldn't even manage the last few bites.  \n\nOkay, so we knew now that this place was not worth the money, but at least we could just apply the cost of the Google Offer and never come back again... at least that is what we thought (and were told on the phone). The owner of the establishment came out to tell us, that we could not do this due to the stipulations in the original coupon.  I patiently informed him that this is no longer a deal -- since the Offer had expired -- but I simply a redeeming of $50 which was already paid. I was rebuffed.  After several minutes of arguing, he agreed to apply the $50 only to food but not to drinks.  More arguing ensued, and out of frustration we paid for the drinks and left. \n\nThus, the owner -- not the waiter or a manager -- of this overpriced \"unpretentious fine dining\" establishment squabbled with us for 10 minutes over a paltry $13 which we had already paid, effectively cheating me out of $26.  An infuriating dessert to a disappointing meal. Buyer beware.",

Honestly, any dessert place on the strip will knock this place out of the map when it came to taste.  The funniest thing is that almost every review of this place only talks about how the desserts look and how they are prepared, barely any of the review tells you how the food actually TASTES.  And if you're going to put ANY sort of food in your mouth, TASTE is pretty damn important. (DUH!)\n\nThe GOOD:\nThe ambiance and the posh-ness of the whole place (very IKEA-ish). I think the BATHROOM takes the cake for me (pun intended).  It was the most exciting part of the whole thing. AND the preparation/presentation of the food was pretty cool.  \n\nTHE BAD:\nAll smokes and mirrors in this place.  When it came to taste, it wasn't even up to par with basic desserts you can make yourself.  HONESTLY, the only thing this place has going for it, is that THEY MAKE THE FOOD LOOK GOOD. So, if you want to impress your friends on Instragram or Pintrest or your social medias, by all means, $25 + tip is not too much, I guess.  But if you want to satisfy your cravings for sweets and dessert, THIS PLACE IS NOT IT.  \n\nETC:\nThe flavor, texture and the complex of their menu items is very bland and I felt like I was eating a bunch of flavored fondant, except they left out the sweetness and delectable aspects of a dessert. There's no comfort in it.  No warmth in the dessert.  It was just plain and simple, OKAY.",

My husband had previously went here and found a couch and love seat he liked in the back area. The employee showed me the one he had saw but then proceed to show me a more expensive one that I liked and a few others I wanted the one she showed me it was 600 dollars more than the one my husband liked. But I could only afford the 900 dollar set. She tries to tell me about financing so we tried that I was not approved. Then she tried to sell me half of the set for the more expensive one but I needed the set. Then I face timed with my husband and I guess this made her feel weird because after I hung up and I guess she found out I was gay her attitude changed telling me if I want the low budget stuff in the back that's fine but she needs to get to other customers. So after so weird type chat I wound go into detail she gets my paper work ready as we are walking to the payment area some other people walk-in and she tops to talk to them and then turns to me and says \"your sale got me a Happy meal I'm going to take care of them so I can make some real money\" handed me my paper work and told me to take up there my self. I never felt so low in my life I tried to get the couch she wanted to sell me but I just couldn't. Now when I look at my couch I think about the experience we had I needed some tables and a light but I think I will go somewhere where I am not made uncomfortable and feel good about my purchases. I hope the manager can get the right people in there.

Let's examine:\n\n Is it clean? Check. Well laid out and efficiently run? Check, check? Friendly staff? Sure. Accessible? Now we've hit on something of a blot.  \n\nAll sorts of buses run to the station which is great for people who are totally carless and there's a nice little kiss-and-ride when you need to pick someone up.  But the parking? Oh my, the parking. While it's true that there are three lots (one good one, one smaller one I would always forget about and what I affectionately refer to as the \"loser lot\") they have all of a sudden, without rhyme or reason or any warning become wholly insufficient. Of course it's usually common sense that one has to get to most public transit lots by a certain time of day in order to secure parking and I guess that's become more or less accepted. However, two other Mississauga Go Stations (Clarkson and Erindale) have these nice, massive new parking garages. Port Credit? Good luck. \n\nI used to be able to time my commute and never have trouble finding a spot in the \"good\" lot if I left at a certain time. However, that all changed about three weeks ago. Parking became a zoo overnight and I'm at a loss to explain why. The good lot is filled up by the time I get there, with many people often parking quite illegally and basically blocking others in. I'm able to get to a spot in one of the lesser lots without trouble but again, I have no idea why the parking situation has deteriorated so quickly. It's a madhouse. If you're not there before 8:00 AM, you're completely and totally screwed. Today I had doctor's appointment and just for fun tried to see if I might somehow find a spot when I arrived at the station around 10:45. The fact that I somehow found one vacant spot in one of the three lots was a minor miracle.\n\nWhat used to be a solid four star station is now a two and if things get worse, a one.

( I had to figure it out and direct the nurses)\n\nThe nurses I'm sure would like to do the above, but being short staffed doesn't allow them too.\n\nThe staff was very loud outside patients rooms. They were all fluffy with each other even at night making it difficult for my husband to relax.\n\nWould I go here again...not by choice but I wouldn't freak out if I was admitted.",

The hotel is about a quarter mile from the strip, so if you have the itch to be in the middle of the Vegas action then it's a short walk away. The other benefit of staying at this location is that you do not have to walk the gauntlet of poker machines, table games and old ladies puffing on their cigarettes to make it to the check in desk. Both of those are great, but what you are paying for is the room. \n\nThe casino is owned by a separate company rather than Westin. Most of the games are slots and electronic poker. There are a handful of table games.  It's a non smoking hotel, but a smoking casino...which makes for a smoking hotel. \n\nCheck in was easy and friendly. The front desk agent was very helpful and informative. A nice start to our stay. Rooms are lacking quite a bit compared to their competition, and our room just smelled like Chinese take out. The double rooms are fairly tight and do not offer much room to move around. The tube TV is out dated, the furniture is stained along with the carpet and wallpaper is peeling.  The bathrooms are average sized and offer all the amenities you would expect from a Westin. However, the water pressure for the shower is miserable, and their Heavenly Shower with a double head on it is pointless. I prefer a shower that works properly before they start attaching the bells and whistles on it. The Heavenly Beds are comfortable and the AC works great. Finally, the housekeeping is a joke. The only service they provide is making the bed. Forget about organizing the room or the bathroom. \n\nThe non resort Westin charges a resort fee for things you never or rarely use...like incoming faxes.  It's like an apartment charging you pet rent.  It makes no sense.  They also state that your $11 daily fee gets you \"free\" water.  I can't quite figure that one out.  \n\nA 24 hour Starbucks is in the lobby, so if you're hitting the slots and on a roll at 4am and need to keep going, you can grab your coffee.  The restaurant is 24 hours as well.\n\nOverall, a decent hotel at best. Great location, great friendly staff but the Westin suffers in taking care of the details.  If they are asking for more than $100 a night...keep looking.",

But the ladies behind the counter aren't the nicest in the world. I always like to take a second to review the menu to see if there's any particular that pique my appetite.\n\nThe minute you walk in the door, you feel pretty rushed. The ladies behind the counter stare at you and while you're trying to decide what you want they'll start asking what you want as though you've had a full ten minutes to review the menu. Although you walked in a customer, you immediately feel like an inconvenience. They've never smiled at me, not that they really need to but you don't exactly feel valued either. They take your order and it comes out quickly. They'll package it up quite nicely for you. The Pierogies are always a bit overdone but they're fantastic and flavorful. The jalape\u00f1o ones are super spicy but absolutely delicious if you're into that type. Their potato and cheese pierogi dish is also fantastic but the best part is the onion. Always ask for extra.

Sensation Canada has got to be up there with one of the worst event experiences. \n\nLets start of with the music. I could not believe how bad the music setup was. IT WAS SO MUFFLED. Unless you are within the first 50 meters of the stage, it was nearly impossible to get any kind of grove going. 150$ to listen to your favorite DJ's on a terrible music set up is like having a medium rare steak ice cold.   Don't the organizers see this ? Don't they run tests to see the music denoting heavy distortion throughout the venue ? Horrible\n\nVisuals. Totally out of sync with the music, with different types of music playing (Electro house, Prog house, Trance, Electro-Pop etc etc), the props had no idea what they were doing. I wish someone could kindly please tell me what the jelly fish were for? I had high hopes for the visual aspect of sensation but it was a giant let down. Granted, the lasers were phenomenal.\n\nSecurity were fairly lenient  about smoking inside and ID checks \n\nOne thing that i have to give credit for is the sheer amount of beautiful women there.

I live close enough to walk there and back, so parking is never a problem and is not factored into my review at all.\nLet's start with the good things, beause there are many.\nThe coffee is good.  The breakfasts are awesome.  The sandwiches almost never disappoint. The bathroom is always spotless. They have cool stuff like Necco wafers and Black Jack gum for sale.\n\nThere are two  things that bring it down a half a star.\n1.  The music is  REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, loud!  ALWAYS!!!!\n2.Ordering and paying is stressful and chaotic since there are two cash registers, but no ryhme or reason as to which side to go to, and many times I have waited in line only to have someone walk in, bypass the line, and talk to someone over the bakery case, and get served---that can make you feel homicidal and the staff gives off a vibe that doesn't discourage that kind of behavior.\nNow, let's get to why it is a possible 4 instead of a possible 5.  It lost a whole star for the following reasons.\n\n1.  The specifically have  a parking spot out front for \"curbside while you wait service\" (also for pick up of called in orders I believe)  you can wait in your car until you die before someone comes out.  You have to go inside and get someone.  Just turn the damned parking spot into a handicapped spot and at least then someone can use it!!!\n \n2. the handicapped spots are all the way at the end of the sidewalk to the north, so if someone has a wheelchair or a walker, not only do they have to go a  fair bit, but, and here's the big one, they have to SQUEEZE by the cafe tables and chairs and people, and people with dogs, that are lined up in front. I don't know about you, but I feel like an ignorant pig when I am using one of those front tables and someone needs to get by me, but I had my headphones on, or my head in a book, and they are waiting  helpless.\nI hate this!!!!!  To top it all off----\nRecently, I just experienced it from the handicapped point while taking my mom there for a cup of tea and a cookie.\n\nIt stinks!  If they move the handicapped spots to the spot where they have the USELESS \"curbside service\"  I will up this review to 4.5 stars.\n\nIf they do that AND lower the music to an enjoyable level, They get 5 stars.\n\nUPDATE: \nI now only go either fairly late in the evening or when dragged by someone else.\nI've decided that my money is better spent somewhere more tranquil.  Still deserves 3 stars I guess.",

We had chicken fingers, wings, and zucchini fries. Everything was delicious! Easily one of the juiciest and crunchiest chicken fingers I've had, but I don't think we'd ever go back solely because of the crappy service. \n\nThere was only one barista working, so I can understand her feeling overwhelmed or aggitated (even though there was roughly only 5 other customers aside from us). She was rude and I'm not sure she knows how to work in hospitality. We also ordered some chicken fingers to-go and when she served us the order on the plate, I had to remind her I asked for it to-go. To which her response was, \"No you didn't say that.\" After a few moments of awkward stares in silence, my boyfriend had to just come out and ask for a take-out container. She should be fired, honestly, seeing as others have had the same crappy service from probably the same female server.\n\nRecommend you try the bar food here only if you have the patience to ignore servers with lousy attitudes.",

We were seated in this awkward space to the side of the hostess stand where people would constantly bump up against you when they went to ask for a table. There really should not have been a table there at all. Too much traffic. However, there was a light above us, so we could actually see our menu and meals. I saw other patrons using their cellphone lights to read their menus. \n\nOur waiter was very nice and not intrusive. He seemed very busy, though. There were several large groups that came in and they seemed to be the priority. Again, not a huge problem. \n\nThe food, however, was pretty terrible. I opted for one of their table d'hote options, which was a salad or soup and a main dish. I also thought it was supposed to come with dessert,  but I never was offered any, so perhaps not. I got their osso buco as my main dish, upon consulting the larger menu, which said it was a house specialty. It came with either penne in a red sauce or vegetables. The osso buco was in a super salty brown sauce, although the meat fell off the bone. The penne was cooked well, but the red sauce lacked any depth of flavor, even with cheese sprinkled on top. My husband got penne with sausage and broccolini in a butter cream sauce. He also said it was one dimensional and lacking in flavor. There was nothing interesting in any of the food we ate, and I was especially unimpressed with the \"house specialty\". I saw a waiter walk by with a pizza that looked good, but dang. Overall, we spent $65 including tip on a pretty awful meal.",

The place does have a pretty cool atmosphere and our service was good.  Those are the only two compliments I can really think of though.\n\nFor appetizers we got the chips and salsa.  It came with two different salsas, pico, and we also ordered the queso.  For some reason the queso is not on their menu, but they do have it.  Both salsas were very average.  They did not have any real flavor.  The pico was also nothing special.  The queso was good but I've had much better.\n\nFor our meals I ordered fish tacos and my wife ordered chicken tacos.  I could barely taste the ingredients of my tacos because the bland corn shells were so much that it overpowered everything.  When I tried the fish tacos with just my fork I was not impressed either.  Again, just very little flavor.  I tried my wife's chicken tacos and they were very dry.  They definitely were in need of some sort of sauce.  \n\nWith so many good Mexican options in Pittsburgh, I would definitely not recommend this place.",

        "text": "I purchased this groupon thinking that this small business nestled into the heart of my residential neighborhood would be worth my business as well as money. I WAS WRONG. \n\nThe manager at the front desk was rude and inconsiderate. He was curt and short with his answers and continued to attempt to sell me things I assured him I did not want to purchase. Like a full replacement of my CV joints. I have taken my car to TWO other shops/technicians who inspected my car for any issues regarding my CV joints. Both other technicians assured me that there is nothing wrong and that such a replacement was not only unnecessary but overpriced given the estimate I had from this shop. When I refused to have such a replacement, they used scare tactics to persuade me to purchase it anyway by signing a waiver of release saying my vehicle is unsafe to drive. It is not. \n\nBut this was the LEAST of my issues. When I went in for an oil change on Saturday the 26th not only was I bombarded by Tony's complete lack of customer care and his less than desirable attitude but they DID NOT FILL MY CAR UP WITH OIL. My car started knocking after the oil change. I drove it lightly but still heard the knocking. It was getting worse with each day but I was confident that even though Auto Tech had shoddy customer service, there was no way they could screw up an oil job. Finally yesterday afternoon after an increase in knocking I checked my oil...and it was BARE. There was nothing by dried CHUNKS in my oil pan and on my dipstick!! Obviously I could not drive it at this point unless I wanted to risk FURTHER DAMAGE. But when I called to see what was wrong Tony was less than receptive. Offering nothing close to an apology but rather just a number to call to have it towed and telling me that it was MY FAULT. I would never take my business to them again. I wouldn't even let them touch my car to correct the problem. Now I am not sure if there is lasting damage or how to have it handled! What a mess! \n\nBottom line, these guys are scam artists. When I posted something about it on a social media site SO MANY people came out across the valley admitting to having some serious problems with the SAME SHOP. These people are BAD BUSINESS. I fully intend to contact my local news channel and further investigate the wrongdoings of these scammers within our community. \n\nI DEMAND A REFUND. I am also asking that the shop cover the damages and repairs to my car. \n\nRegards, \n\nRachelle S. Bressgi",

        "text": "This is a long overdue review.\n\nI traveled to Pittsburgh on a week-long business trip. Given that I prefer peace and quiet when not in meetings and social events, this seemed like a great situation. As many other reviewers have said, this hotel is very much hidden away, with a great team of very courteous staff. Unfortunately, many other factors ultimately made this a very average stay despite the staff.\n\nLet's start with the good. When I first checked in, front desk manager Michelle was extremely friendly and checked me in promptly. In addition, my request for a fridge and microwave involved only a one-time charge of $10, which is more than reasonable. The hotel shuttle staff was great too. Although officially, their shuttle is for airport transportation only, but they offered to drop me off at Robinson Town Center to be picked up later so that I can do some shopping. For the entire duration of my stay, it was rather hassle-free.\n\nNotice that the only positives I pointed out relate directly to this hotel's service. That's because the level of comfort is simply not there. Despite the great service, the staff obviously has to make do with what they got. And what they got here is an old hotel building in a bad situation. First, the room I stayed in was particularly damp. Granted, the week of my stay also happened to be rather humid. But when I put on my dress shirt that was hung in their closet, it felt wet! That level of humidity inside a room is absolutely absurd. Second, the air conditioning was extremely loud, and not entirely functional either. Though I could have raised this to the management's attention, but I chose not to because it wasn't intolerable and I don't think there's a short term fix for it. Third, the hotel wifi, although free, is very slow. I believe it was outsourced to a third party provider named Ethostream. Perhaps due to the age of the hotel, no ethernet corded online service is provided to the rooms. This made getting work done in the evenings after a day of meeting extremely difficult, as my company uses cloud storage solution for many shared documents. The fitness center contained two treadmills, two ellipticals, one recumbent bike, and a set of free weights ranging from 5 lbs up to 50 lbs. Curiously, 30 lbs weights were missing. One of the ellipticals is badly in need of replacement or repair. The room is cooled by a wall-mounted A/C unit with a non-functional ceiling fan. Courtesy towels and water cooler is provided for cleaning and hydration. There's also one single wall-mounted LCD TV. In other words, the fitness facility here is rather barebones. Speaking of LCD TV, hotel rooms are equipped with old tube TVs. So if you watch a lot of TV, you'd get disappointed. When the A/C kicks on, your TV volume will need to be raised up to at least 50% for audibility. Going back to the level of humidity. My bed felt somewhat damp too, perhaps partially due to the fact that the hotel is surrounded by small hills that tend to trap moisture in humid environments. And speaking of location...\n\nSo, the hotel wasn't always \"out of the way\". The staff told me that once upon a time, the Pittsburgh Airport was much closer. After moving the airport, they also eliminated a highway exit ramp that used to lead directly to the hotel. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but the Pittsburgh taxi service is atrocious. You can't prearrange pick-up with taxi drivers either, as they are not allowed to arrange fares for themselves. Every taxi fare MUST go through a central dispatcher due to union rules. What that translates in to is that when you need a taxi, you absolutely must call ahead. Even if you do, chances are they will be late to pick you up.\n\nAll in all, the staff was tremendous. They are absolutely making the best out of a bad situation for the hotel. The hotel is old, and inconvenient as far as accessibility is concerned. Despite the great service I received, there's only so much the staff can do when the physical environment is so challenging. So I can't honestly recommend this hotel for any extended duration of stay. However, I can certainly see how this may be a great park-stay-fly situation.",

She was notably busy and overwhelmed. She had a full bar and 8 tables with people still rolling through the door including a 7 top. What baffeled me is why she was left alone??!! No manager to lend a helping hand, no server on the floor to take tables. It was just all so hard to watch and I felt truly sorry watching her struggle. To make matters worse there was absoulutly nothing stocked or preped for her. She was litterly having to cut fruit for one drink at a time slowing her down even more. All in all I would go back but management needs to step up their game, schedule appropriately, and set their staff up for success. Clearly service is an issue from reading other reviews.

HE'S JUST NOT AS GOOD AS HE USED TO BE.  Maybe he's jaded by fame, maybe he's tired from performing in too many shows; whatever it is, it's not worth your money. \n\nJeff was 15 minutes late (claimed technical defect).  After a slideshow of his life before fame, he then spent the next 15 minutes discussing his (significantly younger) new wife, their twins (she's 5 months preggers), her cookies that she is now selling, her blog, and her twitter-- he even gave out her twitter handle, seriously.   \n\nHe then spend about 30 minutes doing essentially what was a \"live infomercial\" for his new ventriloquism starter kit witch includes a \"little Jeff dummy\" that is sold in the gift shop.  He even read from/performed the ventriloquism act from the book that's sold with the kit.  I don't want to learn ventriloquism, I wanted to see it performed by a professional.\n\nThe ventriloquism act itself was short, and, honestly was just okay.  Jeff spent about 5-10 minutes on each of the characters (Walter, Bubba J, Peanut + Jose, and Achmed).  I've seen him perform better in the past. The voices were not good as they used to be and a lot of the characters said the same lines--- \"funny as hell\", it seems he's just phoning it in and collecting the cash.   He's not the same eager performer as he was years ago and you can see this in his act.\n\nHe performed new material for our audience, but he really hadn't rehearsed it and was just reading from a note pad.  While I appreciate the new material, dude, take 10 minutes and memorize and rehearse your new set.  It's not a free show on the street, this is a show people paid good money to watch.\n\nThe older crowd-- that likely never watched youtube- seemed to very much enjoy the show, but i'm assuming if you're checking yelp, you're computer savvy and will regret your decision to see this show.

The only problem I encountered here was the maze of the hallways.  I got lost trying to find other family members' rooms.  I went around in circles and asked the maids a few times.  I'm pretty terrible with directions to begin with, but getting lost in a freakin' hotel?  That's a new one even for me.  Go for the cheap rates and the free shuttle.  It's a bargain.  I think the \"tower\" rooms on the upper level were nicer than the cheap-o rooms we got, but hey you get what you pay for.",

Chicken soup with soft noodle squares was bland even after adding salt, pepper and chili oil.\n- Cauliflower Salt and Pepper - they're dusted and deep fried. Great flavor, cauliflower is soft but edges are crispy. Gotta thank all the Yelpers for recommending this one.\n\nOnce food was dropped off, they didn't come by to check on us. Had to flag them down for the check and then later for to-go containers. Lunch prices are very affordable but entrees are heavy on the carby side. \n\nWent to Himalayan Kitchen few doors down for some steamed beef momos and Tibetan tea, prices are similar but the difference in service is vast; Himalayan Kitchen staff are warm, friendly, accommodating and have no problem answering any and all questions. \n\nNot sure I'll be back, think I'll try out the many other Himalayan restaurants in the area first.",

Melt salads are a staple of my diet and you can read my check in for the details of the awesomeness of their house and Asian noodle salads. Besides the salads, the other thing I love about melt, again atypical, is the fact that they have plentiful vegan and vegetarian options - which is not what one would think of when one thinks of melt. Any sandwich that you get can be made with vegan cheese (I'll leave it up to you to decide if the lack of lacto is worth the lack of flavor: vegan cheese sandwiches here are more similar to melted frisbee sandwiches, tbh, but maybe vegan cheese is a flavor one's palate grows accustomed to?), many melt sandwiches are vegetarian, and the servers \"get\" most other dietary restrictions. So, if you know Melt as a restaurant with sandwiches you cannot even finish, go back, and give them another try--for everything else.",

All of the pink and crystal screams girlfriends' getaway or bachelorette party. Wonderful modern furnishings and lighting.  One of the few hotels on the Strip with balconies. And they have a hammam in the spa.\n\nThe beds are very comfortable, and all of the room options are very spacious. If not traveling at a peak time, you probably don't need to upgrade online- you'll very likely be offered a premium room at check-in for some de minimis sum like $15-30 a night - everyone in my group had this option.\n\nAnd then the downsides:  When I first opened my balcony doors, my room was visited with a plague of moths that took quite a bit of time to get out. I later found a multitude of them roosting in my patio furniture. There was some ozone-generating contraption running in my room when I checked in (seriously - ozone is a pollutant - gross) that I'm led to believe is intended to mask various odors. The jacuzzi jets turned themselves on randomly throughout my stay, which the front desk informed me was a feature to prevent mildew. Also, the feather pillows smelled of mildew. I thought there was no humidity in this town? All of these things together lead me to believe this room or floor had some kind of water issue not too long prior to my check-in. \n\nDon't touch anything in the minibar unless you want to pay for it. This includes the cute little package of lube they have on there. Yeah, that ended up on my (corporate) bill requiring me to stand around at the front desk to get it removed. I found this hilarious but mileage may vary on this one.\n\nAlso, if you place a room service order, you'll note that a gratuity (along with a service charge and tax) is already added to your bill. However, there's also an option to tip. If you're not planning an extra tip on top of that gratuity, put a 0 or a line there or something.

The stunts seemed out of place and inconsistent with the \"MJ\" theme. 5. Chinese character with martial art choreography? Does this really encapsulate MJ?\n\nMore importantly, the overall direction of the show seems misplaced. Most of the audience were middle aged people who wanted to experience something remotely magical as if MJ was there performing in front of them. Instead we get a bunch of high schoolers dancing to MJ music with a bare resemblance of MJs classic moves. Speaking of dance moves, I expected something similar to Youtube dance covers by amateurs- not as perfect as the real thing but something that most would consider impressive. However, in terms of choreography I would rate the performance above high school talent show and below Youtubers.  Then again, my expectation was something near Jabbawockeez in respect to precision and coordination. Lastly, all the technology they implemented were unoriginal and were  better executed by other performers in the industry.\n\nAs a die hard fan of MJ for 18+ years, this was a huge let down and tarnishes Michael's name.

I've read plenty about this place over the past few years, all the reviews from my fellow Yelpers, and now the Bon Appetit magazine top ten-this must be the best BBQ in Phoenix, I thought to myself.\nFirst thing that strikes you is the chalkboard menus that really don't make a lot of sense so being my first time I studied it for several minutes to see all what they offered.  I was somewhat surprised that they didn't offer combo type plates, but I can always manage to find something to shove in the ol' gullet.  Half a chicken, side of mac & cheese and a drink was just over ten bucks and as others have pointed out CASH ONLY (and there were still dumb people at the counter asking 'does that mean no debit cards??').\nI sat down in the very spartan dining room and thought about what the meal would be like.  I think BBQ is sort of like politics-people are very staunch in their beliefs and anything outside that just plain sucks.  While I certainly try to be open minded, I'm definitely a BBQ-means-the-art-behind-smoking-the-meat kind of gal.  Sauce should be minimal, if at all, but it appears Stacy's has a different interpretation.  There was probably a half a cup of sauce that my chicken was swimming in.  To their credit the sauce was decent and not overly sweet, I believe I tasted a hint of celery which was different.  \nUnfortunately since I arrived just as they opened it sure seemed like I got yesterday's leftovers.  Not that it's a bad thing necessarily, but the patrons should not be able to tell.  The chicken was drenched, likely to try and disguise it was on the dry side, and the mac & cheese had the pool of oil on top which is a tell-tale side of a reheat (anyone who's made their own mac & cheese knows what I mean).\nI'm on the fence as to whether I'll return to Stacy's, it is some of the better I've had in Phoenix but not great at least in my humble opinion.",

The only reason I renewed my lease was due to a short term unemployment and not having the funds to move when my renewal came up. I absolutely will not be renewing this time around.\n\n2.) When I first moved into my apartment, I had a bug problem. Cockroaches would come out of the bathtub, out of the sinks, and little bugs would be on the counter every evening. I was only able to resolve this by spraying every evening straight for a week. Disgusting.\n\n3.) they call this a gated community. The gate on Central is never working. If they do fix it, it works for two days. Do not consider this a gated community if you move in. What's the issue with this? My vehicle was broken into two weeks ago and I had things stolen out of it. Possibly, if the gate was actually working so random people couldn't just walk in this may have been avoided. Icing on the cake, my neighbor across the hallway had his car slammed into the brick wall by a drunk driver in the community. Their cameras couldn't even get the vehicle who did it. Not exactly my problem, but imagine if that was you.\n\n4.) Front office people, awful. All you have to do is have emotional empathy to be in customer service and God for bid they show any of that. After two months of signing my second lease, they decided to change their terms and conditions to make residents pay their full water and sewer utility bill. They say this isnt a big deal because it's only an additional $10 but with all of your bills going up that additional $10 adds up.  I spoke to the manager with my concerns because I was very aggravated when they did this, if she would've just given me emotional empathy I would've back down and not had an argument with her. But she just kept saying it was in my contract and just kept telling me that it's only $10 a month. That's just one example of many, I've had multiple communication with office staff and the only one that I've ever had a resolution with was Jordan. That's the only kind thing I have to say in regards to my review. \n\n5.) Parents let their children roam free with no supervision. They play in the hallway screaming and at the pool are swearing up a storm- you want a child friendly environment this is not the place for it. The fact that children are at the pool swearing and throwing the lawn chairs in the pool, absolutely disrespectful behavior\n\n6.) my appliances have broken multiple times in my unit, and it can take them 2 to 3 days to fix it. When you're doing your laundry and your dryer breaks and now your clothes have to sit for three days, that's disgusting. The fact that my dryer has broken five times during my lease, they must not be fixing it right and won't replace it. I've had my clothing destroyed because of issues with my dryer. \n\n7.) My electricity bill is astronomical due to improper ventilation. The ceiling boards appear to have a molding issue and cracking. I've added a lot of Jacore to my apartment to make it look cute, but you can't hide that.\n\n8.) and finally, the walls are paper thin. My neighbors stomp so hard and after I have asked them multiple times to keep it down they do not. I've asked front desk to give them a courtesy call and the issue still resumes. If I'm in the restroom when they are, I can literally hear them peeing. They're cheap units, and the entire complex is just cheap feeling. If you're OK with that and everything else- then feel free to move in. But I warn you to not. $842 a month w utilities for cheapness and frustration .... just pay else where.",

Also, if you're into basketball as much as me, there are always 5 on 5 pick-up games going on at this location during the weekdays which are pretty fun. There's also a One Stop Nutrition and a Subway in the same parking lot as the place which is great for people looking to eat healthy before/after gym time.\n\nNow...onto why I am giving this LA Fitness location 2 stars...one of my family members had their car broken into here just a few months ago. Some person straight up shattered the glass and grabbed a backpack and took off. Of course, nothing of value was in the bag, but this location is probably in one of the rougher areas of town. It's because the light rail runs along Camelback next to the gym where there are cop cars there every other week addressing problems. There's always homeless people hanging out outside the Frys and McDonalds next door. One time I even saw two kids barely 10 years old standing outside of the entrance to the gym begging people for money. All of this plays into the customer experience as gym members. LA Fitness management simply won't do anything about it either, even if you ask or leave feedback-which I guess is expected seeing as how this is a corporate joint. \n\nIt's an awesome facility that I will continue to give my business to simply because there aren't any other options nearby that beat this on amenities-but if you lived near 20th St. & Camelback or near McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale, I'd go to those LA Fitness gyms if you were looking for an optimal experience.

        "text": "I'm going to try and be fair, given they've only been open about a month.  That said, I cannot fathom the 5 star reviews lavished on The Upton in the short time they've been open.  From my perspective, they are very much in the throes of shaking out the new restaurant kinks.  I credit the creativeness of the menu, which matches Asian and American flavors in intriguing ways.  However, I don't care how good you say the ramen is.  I live in the SF Bay Area, and have my pick of some of the best Japanese noodles this side of Tokyo.  My guess is that ramen is a new and, somewhat exotic, concept in Arizona, so I'm sure this is why it's perceived as \"so amazing\".  \n\nAnyway, on to the meal at hand.  My dinner date and I ordered the burrata starter, which resembled just regular mozzarella without any of the characteristic oozy creaminess inside.   Up next was the Mason jar chopped salad, which was essentially a salad parfait that is then tossed table side.  Yeah, it's a little gimmicky, but the salad may have been the best thing we ate all night.  My date wanted to order the fried chicken, which apparently is the best item on the menu.  So good, in fact, that our waiter informed us they were out and it would be 30 minutes before a fresh batch was battered.  Deterred, so settled on the wild salmon as a backup and I placed my order for the bistro steak.  A few minutes later, we decided that waiting 30 minutes for the fried chicken wasn't so bad and we flagged down the owner to have the order changed.  Unfortunately, he did not pass the message to our waiter or the kitchen.  This was confirmed when out waiter came around.  He then proceeded to inform us it would be far more than 30 minutes, since they have to, inexplicably, close the whole kitchen down to fry the chicken.  It seems that they only have one fryer, and the temperature for the chicken is lower than the other fried items on the menu.  This seems like a major oversight when planning the kitchen layout.  The owner later indicated he was going to buy a 2nd fryer the following week.\n\nSo, back to plan B.  Anyway, our orders arrived and they were underwhelming.  My steak, although properly cooked, was well under-seasoned and fairly boring.  The salmon was a tad over cooked, but otherwise fine on its own and pretty good with the accompanying yogurt sauce.\n\nService was...overly eager.  No fewer than 6 times was I asked if my plate could be taken away, when it should have been fairly obvious that I was still working on it.\n\nWe decided to pass on dessert and call it an evening.  I think what was most disappointing is that the previous restaurant in this space, Le Petit Maison, was so very good.  Hopefully the kitchen and staff at the Upton will hit a stride, but they just aren't there yet.",

So we sat and the hostess didn't really want us there. Then the server didn't really either, he wasn't rude but you can tell he had preferences between guests. He went to the people that were next to us about five times and he only came by us twice. Including the people to the other side of us. \n\nThe food however wasn't very good we both had the pork rice bowls. The pork hadn't been cleaned whats meant to be trashed was in my plate as food. You cant also tell it was the cheap kind of pork. Eww. Terrible.  \n\nAlso had the pork buns which were actually good but again they weren't cleaned. Rather would've had the spring rolls or even the wonton soup for a the full dinner.\n\nIts also not a thing of mine to review drinks but I had a mountain dew and that was $4 we had two of those. Which meant I paid $8 for 2 sodas. Ridiculous. Seriously, not worth it but good enough to try after all this time of wanting to come by here. \n\nService was also very slow. No just noooo. I mean I really wanted to like this place but the pork sides really need to be cleaned off. That's disgusting. $44 for two people and would have been a lot less had it not been for the $8 sodas. Again stupidity to pay that much for two sodas. I would have stopped at the gas station and boughten a drink there for $3.50 less. \n\nSorry yall to work on the prices and food. Also service wasn't rude but he was in the kitchen most of the time how would he know if his guests need anything if he's always in there. \n\nAlso the place was small and you can tell they really force people in there. Need to take out at least 1 table per section. I could hear what everyone else was talking and eating they were about less then 2 feet away from where I was sitting.

They also didn't have kiwi and that's one of my favorite toppings. The strawberries were definitely fresh, the blackberries were frozen and a bit mushy. the rest of the fruit didn't look appetizing \n\n- the price. Either their yogurt and fruit are heavier than other places or they charge more. I am used to paying right around $4- give or take a dollar-at most places for what i usually build. I usually do a little yogurt and then i pile on the fruit. I had a $1 off coupon and my total was just under $7. Yikes!! \n\nThey had quite a bit larger of a selection of toppings than other places and that was cool- it was mostly candy options for the sweet toothed. They also had cake cones and waffle cones which i haven't seen at other places. \n\nI would come back with kids because of all the candy choices but i probably wouldn't be back on my own since they don't have the fresh fruit options that i like.\n\nand i'm knocking down a star for the fake reviews.",

I ordered the Baingan Patiala (eggplant), the Shrimp Makhni, the garlic naan, and the gulab jamuns. The food came quickly enough, especially considering how far I live from the restaurant. When I opened the containers, what a disappointment. Immediately all I could smell was this overwhelming smell of cumin seeds. The eggplant dish was filled with them, it was clear that someone had accidentally poured an entire bag of cumin seeds into the dish. It was inedible. Every bite had 5-10 cumin seeds, it was almost as many cumin seeds as eggplant. Not only that, but the eggplant was extremely greasy and poorly cooked, clearly raw in several areas. The Shrimp Makhni was OK, nothing special. The shrimp was overcooked and it would have been nice if there were some vegetables in it, the sauce was also pretty bland. The naan was OK but for $3.50, all I got was two sad and thin pieces. Definitely not worth the price at all. The Gulab Jamuns were good.\n\nI think it's going to be a while before I can even eat Indian food again after this experience. Stay away at all costs.",

The Blues Can claims to fill the void, but only partially delivers.\n\nThe Blues Can makes some of the same old mistakes that countless lame Calgary bars / wanna be music venues make.  Overcharging for drinks after happy hour is one. Juuuuust bloody well have at least one thing every night thats $3.50 or $4.00. Maybe become famous for $4 cans of Canadian all the time or something.\n\n Also, an exorbitant cover charge gets boring. Charge $5 and book local acts who dont demand  high guarantees but sound the same or better as the \"well known\" stuff, which is often generic crap anyway (Bill Dowey for example). Then..... once in a while charge $12 or $15 for someone whos ACTUALLY well known? DO you know what you could have charged for tickets if YOU had Johnny WInter when he came thru town last month?? A fortune if you had your act together man! :)  \n\nOn one of my visits to the Blues Can, I nearly cried because there were no blues at all!

The items I saw around the store, and my friend with me agreed, seemed like more than 40% really were more appropriate for a thrift store, and a lot of the items were really dirty (and still had high prices). You could see food stains on a dooney bag.. a coach wristlet, black, had white food smeared all over it... still highly priced for as dirty as it is. The thing is... even if it is a brand.. sometimes your store reputation is worth more than the 10 bucks you'll make by selling something dirty. Just my .02. \n\nI saw sensors put though jeans pockets, wallets (in the leather!) and other questionable placements. When I asked about it.. the sales person just said, well maybe there is someone new who does not put it in the right place. That damages items people are buying, and they may not realize the big holes placed by those sensors. \n\nI loved there \"on the web\" tags. I've never seen that before, but they are really pretty and catch your eye if you want to take a closer look. \n\nI prefer consignment stores to identify the sizes on the hanger by color coding or some such to make it easier to find my sizes.

I was asked to be on the medical trial for a new psoriasis medication that required injections every 2 weeks.  I was to be paid $35 \"tax free\" a visit.  It took almost 8 months to receive my first check, and then received a notification from Dr Bettencourt that I had to claim it on my taxes.  Also after 8 months of minimal results, I expressed my concern to the doctor.  She curtly replied that I was getting paid for this and being given \"free\" topicals.  Said topicals were trial size and lasted a few days only.  \n\nDuring one of the biweekly visits I asked Dr Bettencourt to look at this mole on my leg.  She said I would have to make a regular appointment for her to look at it, even though she was already in the room with me and my pants were off to check the psoriasis.  At the end of the trial, after being seen by the doctor, I asked for a prescription for a topical for my psoriasis.  I was told I would have to make an appointment to be seen by the doctor.  I pointed out that I had just come out of the office after being seen, and was advised that that appointment was for the \"trial\", not for my psoriasis.  \n\nBottom line, Dr Bettencourt is rude and cheap.  And my psoriasis is worse now than before.",

Well, actually, \"tasteless\" would be a good word to describe it too.  It had absolutely no seasoning (at least I couldn't taste any), so I had to douse it in salt, pepper and garlic aioli to even be able to eat it.  I also thought it was weird that the turkey patty was square.  It made me feel like I paid $10 for a burger from Wendy's.  \n\nThe sweet potato fries were probably the best part the meal, which, by the way, don't even come standard as a side to the burger -- you have to pay a whole $5 extra just to get some fries.  All in all, definitely not a meal of burger and fries worthy of $20 (including tax and tip).\n\nFor what it's worth, my friends seemed to enjoy their meals (mushroom burger and portobello sandwich), so maybe it's just the turkey burger.",

It came with a 20 year warranty so how could I go wrong? Well, it's gone wrong. The bed has become increasingly uncomfortable,  to the point that it hurts to sleep on. No problem,  Sleep Number will stand behind their product. Wrong. Turns out my 20 year warranty is \"adjustable\" so I have to pay to replace the gel and foam pads because \"nothing lasts forever Mr. Weller.\" Okay, but if Sleep Number's \"fix\" doesn't resolve the comfort issue, they'll stand behind it, right? Wrong again! They want me to spend between $250 and $500 to see if their \"fix\" helps, make no guarantee that it will, and tell me I am fully responsible for the cost. Anyone interested in a $6,000 bed for cheap? No wonder this company is going down hill.",

The worse part about the experience was probably our waitress. She really couldn't care less if we were her guests or spent money at this restaurant.  She wasn't rude, but really short with us, and she wasn't busy and we are always extremely nice as we work in the same type of business.\nI got my more or less flat Coke and decided not to bother to complain.  My side salad looked a little sad, not the freshest lettuce.  We also had the French onion soup.  It was excellent but unfortunately loaded with pepper.  Now, I like spicy food, but this was really more of a pepper soup  with onions.  Shame that.  I had the sampler dish with lasagna, eggplant and veal parmesan.  The eggplant was absolutely great, the veal parmesan tasty and the lasagna pretty decent.  My wife had the chicken parmesan, she really liked it.\nAll in all, it was average.  Considering the price and the lousy service, I'm going to rate it two stars (I would rate it 2.5 if I could). It's a shame.  Like someone else said, this could be the perfect little place, but not with this staff and some food being below par.",

I especially like that renters now can select the make and model of car from the level reserved.  We chose a brand new Kia Optima which was OK - sluggish, not super outfitted with much but comfortable and serviceable.\n\nThe only mistake I may have made was agreeing to pay for a tank of gas before hand to save me the hassle of filling up before returning the car.  We didn't use a full tank and the cost of gas outside the airport was way less than what they charged us per gallon.  I think they should have provided information about the cost of gas instead of just posting what they charge.\n\nReturning the car was a bit tedious as the signage at this airport is not the best but that's not the rental car company's fault.  Once there, returning the vehicle was pretty simple although the attendant did not take time to explain how our charges were computed which I thought were confusing when I finally took the time to review them after returning home.\n\nI have rented cars from Alamo in the past in Orlando several years ago and always had a positive experience especially when they would offer a model upgrade for no additional charge.

There are much better places in town to get middle eastern food... maybe not Moroccan, per se, but do you really consider two withered beef kabobs jammed in a pineapple with a birthday candle on top Moroccan?!\nI did love the ambience here. The room is cozy, red plush sheikh-chic, like the inside of a Bedouin tent. The bellydancer was really beautiful and very talented, and danced for most of the meal. The service was pretty good, and the seats are comfy. In short, everything was going along great until the food arrived!\nOK, maybe I don't know enough about Moroccan food (I've only been to one other place that serves it), but I was expecting more delicate spices and exotic sweet/savory blends, grilled meats and interesting stuff like that. What we got was: white bread and shrimp scampi... minestrone soup (OK, it's supposedly \"lentil\" soup but it tasted like Chef Boyardee to me)... a few pickled beets and olives with hummus and more white bread... the aforementioned beef kabobs jammed into a decorative pineapple... some sort of salty stewed chicked and potatoes... and a GINORMOUS apple-baklava-pie thing that looked like it came from the bakery at Costco, doused in powdered sugar and dumped unceremoniously on a plate. I'm kind of a foodie, and this was not foodie-food -- this was food for people who are too busy ogling a bellydancer to care what they're stuffing into their salivating maws.\nI had been wanting to come here for a long time, and  I was very disappointed.  For those seeking an Arabian Nights-vibe, I would recommend Paymon's over this any day -- although they don't have belly dancers, so if that's the main draw for you, then enjoy your white bread and Chef Boyardee... but don't eat the pineapple; they \"wash\" them and re-use 'em.",

I'm not a picky person either, but that's kind of a turn off when your toast is not done... yet too done on the outside.

Now that they are $1.50 each we haven't been back really since.  Economy = SUCKS.\n\nWhenever we end up at Red Rock Casino for date night the wifey and I often end up with a snack or a meal here.  It's probably one of the cheaper places in their food court to get a bite.  As much as I love Capriotti's and some Panda Express, sometimes a guy needs to watch his waistline.  Rubio's fits the bill nicely.  Get a healthy meal with some grilled fish, chicken, or steak, colorful veggies, and a wicked salsa bar.\n\nThe wifey likes her fish tacos, but sometimes will opt for the Pacific Mahi Mahi Burrito.  Mild fish, grilled with seasonings or blackened with spices, wrapped in a whole grain tortilla with fire-roasted corn, guacamole, Mexican rice, cilantro, onion, red and green cabbage, and creamy chipotle sauce.  Actually pretty good eats, very flavorful and definitely health-conscious.\n\nI stick with the Burrito Especial with either steak or chicken.  Marinated meat, grilled, wrapped with guacamole, salsa fresca, sour cream, black beans, Mexican rice, and creamy chipotle sauce.  I usually add lettuce to mine and opt for a whole grain tortilla.  Not authentic Mexican, I know, but darn tasty!  \n\nEach burrito or meal plate usually comes with a side of tortilla chips, perfect for taking advantage of Rubio's salsa bar!  Their signature salsas are all stellar.  I always take more than the usual amount of little plastic containers!  They usually have four salsas on the bar:\n\n-Mild\n-Tomatillo\n-Roasted Chipotle\n-Picante\n\nSometimes I guess depending on season one of the salsas will change.  Once they had a mango salsa, and another time they had a pineapple salsa.  My faves to go with are the tomatillo, and the roasted chipotle.  Complements any of their dishes great.  Also on the salsa bar is cilantro/onion mix, pickled jalapenos, limes, and lemons.  If you're a cheapie, just get yourself a serving of beans and rice, and top it off with everything from the salsa bar!  I've seen it done, and NO, it wasn't me.\n\nBeware though, since this Rubio's is in a casino food court, prices can be a tad bit higher than one in your local neighborhood.  But it's still not too bad.  Our burritos came up to around $8-$9 each with chips and salsa bar included.  Not bad for a date night.\n\nGet in, watch a movie, eat, then go ahead and lose the rest of your money to bingo or video poker!  I prefer CRAPS.",

Well I wasn't impressed because I don't like bell peppers and it wasn't a big deal for my hubby to scrape it off his steak but I had sausage gravy, so it was like digging for unwanted treasure to get it off.\n\nThe sausage gravy was awesome by the way, so were the mashed potatoes, biscuits unfortunately weren't they were dense and pretty dry. You think mine being slathered in gravy would of helped loosen them up but NOPE.\n\nHubby's steak was good even though it was more cooked to my liking which is medium rare, and he ordered medium, he also asked for no tomatoes and yeah they put tomatoes on his.

Both casino and Deli execute such a commendable job with the theme and attention to detail, that a unique dining experience is guaranteed. The New York City motif is so realistic that you expect to hear a taxi careening down the faux Greenwich Village Street, and instead overhear a runaway Manhattan Rollercoaster taxi above with screaming riders. \n\n   When you step off the Greenwich Village Street into Greenberg's Deli, up above on the wall is  the menu. It advertises the New York City Deli icons including the Ruben, corn beef, and pastrami. Disappointedly yet totally expected Kashe varnishes and kinishes were missing. However, there on the board was an egg salad sandwich. I LOVE egg salad sandwiches. They are not the easiest sandwich to find in Las Vegas and especially on the Strip. A few years past, I really enjoyed the Johnny Rockets egg salad sandwich until they got rid of it. The egg salad sandwich is relatively inexpensive for the Las Vegas Strip where a Subway sandwich could cost over $8. I would never want to eat an egg salad sandwich by itself. I'd add a prepackaged potato salad for $1.50 and a fountain Pepsi for a couple of dollars more that came out to $13 and change. \n\n  Before I could enjoy the food I had to pay. This is a two line process. On line 1, I ordered and picked up the sandwich with the prepackaged potato salad and fountain Pepsi before bringing my tray to line 2 to pay. I carried the tray outside to the Greenwich Village Street where the tables are. \n\n  The egg salad sandwich brought back this loving feeling of enjoying delicious food in a New York deli. They served it on between two slices of rye bread (I could of had sourdough). Complimenting the overflowing egg salad that required a fork to savour every bite was onions, tomato, and lettuce. The potato salad was nothing extraordinary. Perhaps, the next time I visit I may enjoy the sandwich with hard to find Wise potato chips or go nearby upstairs to Coney Island to pick up Nathan's crinkley cut fries. \n\n   Sitting in the Greenwich Village Street amplified this New York state of mind that in reality is a New York - New York state of mind. The sights and sounds of the casino is exciting. Up above the runaway New York Express roller coaster taxi careened on the tracks, the Times Square Dueling Piano players rocked the classics across Greenwich Village. Greenberg's Deli with the New York - New York Greenwich Village is the marriage of a Las Vegas and New York deli dining experience that brings back a loving feeling that had been gone gone gone.",

        "text": "I lived here at Camden Breeze for 2 1/2 years. Besides college dorms, it was my very 1st time living on my own. From day 1, I was given nothing but misinformation from these people. Before moving in and signing my lease, I was told that all units, including the one i was going to be inhabiting were going to be upgraded and renovated by the time i moved in. That was lie number one. Although i was able to get them to upgrade my appliances a year later, what i was told at lease signing was not so. My unit had old appliances, dirty carpet that was over 2 years old, and stains in my bathroom sink and in my bath tub. My parents were very unhappy about this, but by this time the lease was already signed so there was nothing that could be done about it. I was excited about living on my own so I didn't let those things bother me too much at the time. The second lie i was told was that there would always be onsite security. After moving in, I noticed that there was sometimes security on the weekends, but they were not onsite and they weren't there everyday or even every weekend. If there was onsite security, the shooting that took place in the complex within my 1st 2 months of living there may not have taken place. Luckily for me, I was out for the night but knowing the shooting took place was always something that made me very nervous. There were also a few other things i was unhappy with while living there. There were 2 different occasions when maintenance entered my apartment without my permission or a work order. Both times, i was woken up completely scared because I was both undressed and asleep( i work graveyard so i usually sleep during the late afternoon and early evening). Another thing, the gate that was right near my unit was constantly broken which meant anyone could enter the complex at any moment. Being a woman, living alone I did not like that at all. I felt like the gate was stuck wide open more than it properly worked. Also, within my last year there everything was just falling apart, i personally took good care of the unit, but because nothing was really upgraded like i was initially told it would be, things were breaking down and becoming inoperable because of age. The last lie I was told was about my deposit. I was told that i would receive my deposit back within a month or so after move out. There were no damages that I personally made to the apartment. Because I had grown to be so unhappy with the place, i chose to move 10 days earlier. For one, they require you to re sign and/or give notice 60 days prior versus 30 days that most places require. Because of that, I did believe that my lease ended earlier than it did, but still i stuck it out to almost the very end. At time of move out and also the time i gave notice I was lied to about receiving my deposit and also about any charges that i would receive based on my move out date. They decided to keep my deposit of almost $400 because i left 10 days early, even though I had asked if I would receive any additional charges for leaving early and they told me NO. I also made multiple payments that were a combination of rent, tech fees, cleaning fees, and the additional lifespan of the 5 year old carpet that was in the unit over my last month living there. They also had my apartment rented out before i even moved. From day 1 i was lied to and on my very last day the lies still continued! The only reason I stayed as long as I did and the only reason I give them 2 stars is because it was in a very convenient location. But they will lie to you to get you moved in and they will steal your deposit!",

That part was a relief, but we were a bit concerned to find several parties waiting and barely being acknowledged when half the restaurant was empty.  When we were finally acknowledged, the host / hostess were not the friendliest, approximating a 15-20 minute wait and forgetting to mention that we could have chosen to sit immediately at their \"community table.\"  We learned about that a few minutes later when another party walked in and sat right down.\n\nLuckily, we didn't have to wait that long and we were seated at a comfy booth about 5-10 minutes later.

Since I thought I was not under a contract I did not have any concerns with leaving the gym after a few months. When I canceled my account the person who took my paperwork  gave me a copy and said that if I got charged again to come back with my receipt. \n\nFast forward to the end of the month where I got charged two separate fees.

The staff member informed me that I got charged for a contract cancellation and for the last month of the membership because I did not give them a month's notice. I informed them that I was offered a no contract membership and the staff member told me that whoever signed me up did not sign me up for the no contract membership and that there was nothing he could do. The staff member also stated he would call me back but he never did.\n\nCommunication between staff definitely requires major improvements.

Sorry , I am not a hipster that the place is full of , but I am a good looking 48 year old man with a skull t-shirt that matches the bar theme and playing your video poker , so can I get a drink .  I decide when I run out of play I am leaving .  The machine gives me decent play where finally the bartender walks by slow enough for me to finally get him to stop and get me the banana drink .  It tasted pretty good , but not anything to brag about .  I put in another $20 since now I had a drink and figured they would come by to ask if I wanted another .  I was going to try a different drink .  Nope , never came by , finished drink , chewed on ice , finished video poker which gave me more attention than the staff .  Wish I would have at least hit a 4 of a kind , but I probably would have never got anyone to cash me out if I did .  I really wanted to have a good time here and come back and bring some friends , but I will not be coming back !  I like the decor and the music , but no service will get no return .",

Another disclaimer: I greatly prefer Downtown to the Strip, and have tried to seek out fun spots to enjoy, so distance from the Strip isn't an issue. They have upgraded/renovated the FSE-facing rooms. Two visits ago they gave me one at no charge, wanted an upcharge the next time. I'm back in a month, for $19/night.\n\nMy rooms have always been clean and smoke free. The heater/aircon units have sometimes been noisy. I don't hear much noise between rooms. The rooftop pool can be a very relaxing low key place to kick back. No worries if you bring your own drinks up if you do it without flaunting it. I don't think i've ever eaten there, but always start the day with coffee from the stand, where you get a free refill with the receipt.\n\nI always park in the outdoor parking lot just on the other side of the bus station. For dining, i try to hit: the weekend champagne next door at the Main St Station; the pizza at the Old Chicago Brewery in the Four Queens; the 1.25 beers at the newly renovated Gold Spike; the absolutely delicious Kabab Korner just across LVB on Fremont; breakfast at Binion's; prime rib at Magnolia's at the 4 Queens; and looking forward to checking out Hugo's Celler there next month.\n\nFun activities include: taking in a baseball game [minor league 51's] at Cashman Field, a 15 minute walk; taking the double decker bus up the Strip [by catching it at the main bus station on Stewart]; enjoying some really cheap Crown drinks at the Dome in the Plaza...\n\nSummary: not for everybody, or for those expecting strip like amenities. The Golden Nugget is the downtown sport for that. But, a decent place for those on a budget who don't mind exploring a bit...",

Not worth ordering again in the future. I had to of course order the bone-in ribeye for my entree. It's disappointing to me when a steakhouse doesn't cook a steak the way you had requested... especially a high end one such as this. I ordered medium-rare. It was definitely cooked medium. I don't usually send food back because other people are with me and I'd have to make them wait. I can still enjoy my food if it's not perfect. However, I do make a note of it on my reviews so that the chefs and future customers know. I'm sure this isn't a mistake that they make regularly (At least I hope not!). I also prefer a saltier steak. It could have used more fat too. I like my hypertension and cholesterol... The sides we ordered for the table were all delicious. Mushrooms & creamed corn were probably the best. Creamed spinach and gratin were just okay. I tried some of my friend's chicken.

The staff were friendly and helpful, even helping me card into my room with hands full of coffee and breakfast.  The overall atmosphere is a winner.\n\nMehs: The hot breakfast looked rather \"pre-fab\", with preformed egg slabs.  The meats looked edible, but I decided to pass that by in favor of a nearby restaurant.  (Bad move on my part; read my other reviews.)  The coffee was hot and plentiful, and the breads etc. were good.  The sole cold-drink vending machine had no colas at all; Seven-Up, Dr Pepper, and water was it.\n\nMinuses:  The rate for our room was pretty steep for the quality of the room and the location of the hotel.  (We also booked on fairly short notice, which might explain the rate.)  If you're on the second floor, prepare to get some exercise when heading to the vending/ice machine.  These are on the first floor, with the only access being stairwells on each end of the building.  (The south stairway to the lobby is highly recommended, especially if the weather is inclement.  The north stairway does not directly connect to the first floor; you exit the building and walk about ten feet to the first-floor entrance.)\n\nOverall: If not for the price of the room, I'd have given a fourth star.  I'd recommend booking a few weeks in advance, which is what I will do the next time my bride and I are in the area.",

In the process of wrestling with my Range Rover, he damaged an air flow sensor that he claimed he fixed with glue.  This ended up costing me $200 to have replaced at my local shop.  He also damaged the fan shroud and fastened the broken clips with zip ties (shoe maker work)!

Was told none of those were available at that time but that cars were being returned and I would definitely get something in my class.\n\nWhen I showed up there was nothing from that class.  There was also nothing to upgrade into, no larger cars or SUVs.  They offered me cars from the next class smaller.  It was a parade of cars in poor shape.\n\nThe first one they put me in had a big buldge in a tire sidewall.  Last thing I need on a long road trip is a blowout, car should not even be rented locally.\n\nNext car offered had a ripped seat and cigarette odor.\n\nNext car offered was not washed/vacuumed, but by this point I had wasted enough time looking at cars and needed to start my trip, so I took it as-is.  Once I started driving, I quickly noticed 3 things: brakes needed work, one tire had a loud \"whomp whomp whomp\" noise to it, and the steering wheel was pointing at 2 o'clock to make the car go straight down the road.  Car needed an alignment at least, maybe suspension work.\n\nI didn't have time to turn around, return to the office and hope they had something better.  This was the 3rd dud I had looked at, and my hopes they had anything in great shape were dashed so I pressed on.  I did get there safely.\n\nIn the defense of Hertz corporate, I called to complain, and they refunded part of my rental fee and said the car in question would be pulled from rotation and repaired.  That is the only thing preventing this from being a 1 star review.",

        "text": "I have been to this Maggiano's numerous times as well as had it catered at our offices, however this review is solely based on the service that we received today (March 10, 2010) \n\nMy company was hosting a going away luncheon for my lovely coworker Samantha, who is leaving us to go to France, but I will stop my ranting about that. BOOO! LOL Anyways back to Maggiano's. It started when we arrived. The hostess was chatting it up with a patron at the bar so we had to wait for her to finish up, now the reason why I am little disturbed as there were two other servers as well as someone who appeared to be a manager standing right by the hostess station. They looked at us, however they did not acknowledge us in the 3 mins we stood there waiting for the hostess to finish her conversation with the patron at the bar. FAIL! \n\nFinally we were acknowledged and we were told where the rest of our party was. We were all seated and about 5 mins or so, drink orders were taken. 15 mins after the orders were taken and we received our drinks,(no I am not over exaggerating either) we get some bread baskets at each table, which was great because we were pretty famished. Fast forward another 15 mins and our appetizers arrived. Now mind you this menu was predetermined days ago so it wasn't like we had to wait for people to order and it was all going to be family style. Now although the appetizers were tasty, we had to wait about another 25 mins after that for the appetizers to be taken away and an additional 20 mins for the lunch to arrive. FAIL! \n\nNow any other time, I would not have a problem if the place was jam packed, but it was not. See what they had failed to mention to us when we arrived is that a water main was broken in front of the restaurant so they no longer had running water. From what I understand, they had brought in more than enough water to get through the lunch rush, but they had called those who had reservations for dinner because they were closing down for the rest of the day due the water main problem. How the hell can you not tell your patrons that you don't have running water and the only way that you find out is because one of your coworkers happens to go to the bathroom and their is someone standing at the door to let you know that there is no running water but there are big coffee pots full of hot water for you to wash your hands however you cannot flush the toilet. WTF??! Great so now we had a better understanding as to why things were taking so long. Had they told us this before hand, I am sure we would have went somewhere else. Especially since we didn't find out until halfway into our meal. FAIL! \n\nMaggiano's I am very disappointed in you today. Our company orders from you quite a bit and I understand that the only discount you gave is that you didn't charge us to take the leftover food back to three coworkers that couldn't make it. Seriously?! Yes I understand that there were circumstances out of your control, but as courtesy you should have told us what was going on and let us decide how to proceed. What should have been a quick 2 hour max lunch turned into a long 3+ hour lunch, which would have been ok any other time had their been working bathrooms. FAIL! \n\nSo like I said, this review is solely based on the service today. Any other time you would get at least 4 stars . Today you only get 1, and that is being generous. If someone from the restaurant happens to read this review, be careful if you decide to email me with \"hate mail\" because you know you guys were in the wrong today. FAIL! FAIL! FAIL!",

This would have been great because I was looking to unload my 07 BMW to get a new model. \nI get to the dealership and no one there has a clue the individuals that I am supposed to be meeting with are not available and when they finally become available it is as though they have forgotten our phone conversation and ask me all the same information about the car for a third time. After an hour they have not even looked at my car and I am starting to get irritated. They ask to borrow my keys so that they can get the mileage off of the vehicle and start the car.

I did not give anyone permission to drive my car, and I asked to speak to a manager. \n\nA large slow gentleman by the name of Terrence that referred to himself as a manager (come to later find out that was a lie and he is an assistant to the manager) came out and acted very disinterested in  supplying any kind of assistance.

He then continued and yelled \"you can't even afford a new car we don't want your business\" in front of me and probably a dozen other customers. I told him that my car had been taken without my permission and that I do not know where it is.

        "text": "First off, the picture listed is NOT the picture of the building. I was mislead by the location because of the picture but that is on me. The following is the complaint I will be submitting to the American Psychiatric Association for the treatment I received at her office:\nI visited Dr. Saleha Baig's office on 9/19/17 at 4pm with an appointment time of 4:15. I knew I would need to fill out new patient paperwork so I arrived early. After completing the paperwork, I was waiting in the waiting room with about 4 other patients. Dr. Baig's office door was left open and I could clearly hear every conversation with every patient. This made me question her confidentiality of patient information but I was in need of a new doctor for a prescription refill so I continued to wait. After two hours of waiting I finally was called back to Dr. Baig's office. Her door was still left open when I came in but I was the last patient since it was just after 6pm. She proceeded to greet me and I began to tell her a bit about my background. Then she asked if I was still taking the medications (she said about five different medications) and I said no I had no idea what she was talking about and then she called me by the wrong patient last name and she realized I not only I was a completely different patient, but I was a brand new patient. She then immediately stood up and started yelling for her receptionist Diane. Diane then entered Dr. Baig's office and Dr. Baig was scolding her in front of me about not scheduling new patients at six o'clock. That is when the receptionist informed her that my appointment was at 4:15 and I had been waiting the whole time. Dr. Baig continued to scold her saying she could not have new patients after four and that the receptionist is overbooking her and this is unacceptable. I then told Dr. Baig she did not need to see me and I could find another doctor. Dr. Baig said I could stay and she would see me but continued to scold the receptionist, and explain that she would need to pray and then see me (I have no prejudice against anyone's beliefs or practices but this would have meant more waiting and I already felt like I was a burden to her at this point). I began to cry because the reason for my visit was a decline in my mental well being and overwhelming stress, in which this instance with Dr. Baig reprimanding her receptionist was causing me more stress. I asked the receptionist and Dr. Baig to destroy my file because I would be seeing a new doctor. About thirty minutes after I left I received a call from Dr. Baig's office and it was Dr. Baig herself. She apologized for acting in that matter, saying she had not used the restroom since the morning and she was very stressed out. I have this voicemail on my phone and I am willing to share it if needed. I find this extremely inappropriate to say as a mental health specialist, especially since I am a teacher and understand that I cannot blame my actions in front of a classroom of students for simple reasons such as not using the restroom. I felt all of Dr. Baig's actions were extremely inappropriate and now I am frantically trying to find a new mental health provider to refill my current prescription and now to help me overcome the stress of my current situation and the situation I encountered with Dr. Baig. As a mental health provider, Dr. Baig should be much more aware of her actions and the way she communicates with her staff, especially in front of a brand new patient. I will be making my insurance aware of Dr. Baig's behavior so that they may consider taking her off the list of in network providers because I would not want anyone else to have to endure that kind of behavior. I would like confirmation that Dr. Baig has been made aware of this situation and hopefully reprimanded for how the situation unfolded.\n\nI will be posting this on as many public forums as possible. This was unacceptable from a mental health provider.",

Fine, but the coupon could be more clear and say \"must be printed\". I returned a few nights later with a \"printed\" coupon and got another cashier to accept it. I also got a digital punch for their Epoxy Loyal Program. Lupe witnessed this and then scolded her cashier to not allow for punches to be given when a BOGO is used. I returned a third time last night. Lupe was the cashier, and once again, she refused a perfectly valid coupon. She said she was just following the rules and that I can contact her manager Benito. When I finally spoke to him today, he told me that I was abusing the system \nby trying to use the Valpak coupon in combination with their Epoxy stamp (Customer Loyalty Program), and that he had me on video. So now I am the sandwich criminal! Their customer service is a joke...instead of just giving me a lousy $4.00 sandwich, they are just jerks about it. I understand that some coupons say \"Not to be combined with any other offer.\" I don't think asking for 1 Epoxy stamp was unreasonable since I was still technically paying for 1 of the 2 sandwiches that I would be getting with the coupon, but if that's against their policy, I can totally understand. But, that isn't reason to just ban me from using the Valpak BOGO coupon. They just have to politely say that I can either use one promotion or the other.

No longer. \n\n  There is a particular male barista (he's been there for several years) whose attitude, along with yes, the ever increasing high prices, have driven me away from this particular location. He is extremely condescending. \n\n  You have a sign posted suggesting that we \"ask\" to try your newest Pumpkin Latte (hot, iced or blended). I figured that since there had been two folks ahead of us and no one behind us, why not ask to try them: which we did, as we'd placed our original orders. \n\n  After receiving our drinks ( of which my large hot Chia Tea Latte was only lukewarm) at a $5.50 hot price, of which I tolerated, I inquired where the sample Pumpkin Lattes were. The \"stale\" male barista simply answered that he was moving as fast as he could but that he had to take care of the other patrons drinks first (at which time another patron or two had walked into the establishment). I chose at that point to simply walk out, as my interaction with that \"non-social\" barista made me remember that he'd been equally rude on my previous visit from last year. \n\n   My suggestion would be to take your sample sign down and don't put it back up again, as clearly your \"non-social\" barista moves at his own slow pace, which is assisting in driving your customers away and causing you to have to raise prices. \n\nPeace out !",

Unfortunately this was my first and last visit.\n\nThe service was awful. Before I proceed, I should mention there were many empty tables and booths. We waited for a long time to just get menus. Another lengthy wait before we could order. The food came fairly fast though. The waiter didn't ask if we needed anything, just sat the food down and walked away. My boyfriend ordered a burger with fries, so he wanted ketchup. It was impossible to get the attention of the 5 servers standing behind the bar talking, so I had to get up and get ketchup off an unbussed table. \n\nWhile we ordered another table was seated next to us. By the time we got our food they still had not received menus. After I got my own ketchup one of them walked up to the front of the restaurant and picked up her own menus.\n\nThe food was pretty tasty. The biscuits with honey and jam were a great little appetizer.  I was told the burger was good, as was the veggie sandwich I ordered. We sat with empty plates for a lengthy time, unable to get a bartender or server to notice us. It took forever for someone to ask if we wanted anything else or just the check. We probably would have ordered another beer, but the restaurant missed out on that. Instead we asked for our check, which again took forever. We left full, but not willing to come back. \n\nThere were so many servers hanging around talking,they were clearly overstaffed. Maybe they would be more attentive to paying customers if there was less time to chat. I honestly think we could have walked away without paying and no one would have noticed. Maybe the Asheville location has better service, but with the abundance of good food in Asheville, they will unfortunately never get my business.",

Shorting the customer and screwing up the orders can be fixed.\n\nPut in an online order at 3:00pm for a 5:30 take out.  I ordered 2 of the Tonkatsu Ramens with Chashu pork and menma, a cucumber roll, spam roll, and a salmon avocado roll.  My fiance did 4 years in Osaka, and loves ramen but doesnt like fish, so we got a few non fish rolls.\n\nUpon opening up the ramen, I thought it was a joke.  One tiny ass piece of Chashu in each, and two single small pieces of menma.  They had to be hiding more underneath right?  Wrong.  Total cheapskate thing to do.  See the picture.  If management at Fukumimi or Monta saw ramen served like that, it would never fly.  On top of that, for $9.00, the portion size was about 60% of any other ramen place in LV.\n\nSushi came out wrong and again they skimped.  Salmon avocado had no avocado.  Come on guys.  Spam roll was some random fish, so the fiance skipped it.  Cucumber roll was not rolled all the way, fell apart.\n\nThe one thing I can say is that their online ordering system is very good.  Better than most.\n\nI do not give many bad reviews, and I review a lot.  Ninja Teriyaki + Sushi To Go could do better, but inattentiveness and just plain cutting corners on the customer is not doing them any favors.  These things could be fixed.  The food isnt bad, but you cant get away with multiple screw ups, poorly executed prep, and cheapskating on customers needs to get called out.  I hope they get it right, I want to see them succeed.",

Upon my arrival to  this store, one of the associates directed me to Raul and he greeted me with a smile, noted the distress on my face and assured me again he would repair it promptly.  He took my keys and immediately parked my car in the garage for repair.  \nWithin thirty minutes my tire was fixed.  Raul informed me I was going to need new tires soon, offered me a very reasonable quote and said to call him before coming to have tires replaced and he would make sure I was cared for promptly.

Deliciously awesome, flavor and presentation, his tom yum martini disgustingly undrinkable. So we ended with another glass of wine. I had spicy tomyum soup that was Luke warm and salty but still pretty good. His coconut milk soup was also Luke warm but flavor was very good. Again like an idiot, I tried Amok steamed in banana leaf (it's my favorite Thai or Cambodian dish) hoping to find a different version from my favorite at la petite Mangue. My man ordered duck in five spices sauce. The duck came out really tough and seemed like it was frozen before. The sauce was really sweet like hoisin. The vegetable was whatever. It was just not good for a $33 entree. He was so excited about duck. My amok smelled way too fishy before the waitress even put it down on the table. I had four pieces of fish in there and the rest was just slimy onion and basil leaves. I think I'm giving up trying this this at any other Asian restaurant. The waiters were nice and friendly and the soups were good but I give up on Sukho thai. It's definitely not worth $100 something for two",

The price is excellent for those on a budget with little travel experience, wanting to be bussed around and taken on shopping excursions every day to 'factories' and whatnot.  This isn't my style at all.  They deviated from the itinerary provided, so all my original plans during 'free time' was scrapped.  It was frustrating to know I traveled this far just to be forced to do things I don't want to.  As a vegetarian, the included lunches were questionable (not sure if there was beef or chicken broth, etc).  The breakfasts were always buffet style, so I was able to eat well there.  Whenever I got to do some exploring on my own, it seemed the tour guide was cautious (probably they're used to tourists getting lost and having to find them).  You're usually on a bus with about 30 people, so if one person is late, everyone is delayed.  \n\nIf you don't do the additional excursions, often you get dropped off in a place there's nothing to do with only an hour.  But then the rest of the group doesn't show up for another 30 min after typically.  \n\nOn the plus side, I can say I cheaply visited Beijing and Shanghai, although I didn't get to do much of what I wanted to do there.  I hated sitting hours waiting for each shopping stop to be over (and some were overpriced).  The silk factory states they sell authentic brand items, but it's even worse quality than the knock-offs I bought off the street for a fraction of the price.  I'm bitter about my overpriced fake Burberry scarf, but I am as ignorant on what marks to look for as most people.\n\nTwo tour guides.  The Beijing one, \"Rock\", was something.  He does throw tantrums, very controlling, irritable.  Inconsistent.  He got mad at us for 30 minutes for buying from street sellers, claiming he 'cared about' us.  Dude, I've known you 24 hours.  If this was an issue, tell us from the beginning. Sunny was nice and helpful and was willing to give more information on times.

Both my friend and I ordered curries, hers green and mine red. Both of our curries looked nice but they were so watery, it was more like a thin soup. It seemed like it needed to be reduced down more because the flavour wasn't as rich as I anticipated (I've been to their old location several times). I peeked over at my neighbor's dishes and their curries were also thin as well, so it appeared it wasn't just an inconsistency with ours but how they were choosing to serve them in general. Plus, I was expecting maybe a few new additions to their menu since it re-opened, but it's just the same as before. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing since that's what made them popular but I was hoping for more. \n\nThe decor of this location is a bit plain although, they did have some fun colourful tiles on a few of their accent walls. For some reason, this new location has more of a fast food vibe and doesn't have the same fun and nosy feel as its old location.

While the hotel itself is in good repair and we enjoy the managers reception and breakfast, we have had some bad experiences which lead to seeking different lodging in the future. \n\nDespite doing online check-in 24 hours before our scheduled check-in and registering for digital key for the room we chose, our room was not available early or even close to on time. We had to wait 45 minutes beyond the promised 4:00 check-in time. We were given a voucher to use in the restaurant but nobody called us. It was only after we returned to the front desk at 4:45 that we were told our room was now ready. \n\nThe kids wanted to swim but they were driven out after just 5 minutes by a very loud, inconsiderate family from Pittsburg who managed to simultaneously neglect and antagonize their own children who in turn jumped directly on other kids, splashed people trying to relax in the hot tub and shouted non-stop. When my kids tried to swim after dinner the same people were there being rude and obnoxious. We were disappointed that no rules or basic courtesy was required by the staff at this property. \n\nWhen it came time to turn down the hide-a-bed sofa we discovered a lack of blankets and pillows. There was just one blanket and no pillows. When we called the front desk to request some, we were told we could come down ourselves but the girl was not sure if she had any or not. Really??\n\nBetween the late check-in, rude patrons and lack of standards we will seek lodging elsewhere in the future. One star for clean rooms, one star for basic ES amenities.

Go figure: the pizza blew away the entree, which proved heavy and underseasoned. It was fine, just not something I'd race back to have again. The pizza was strong, using tarragon and cashews to create something different and tasty. I'd order it again in a heartbeat.\n\nMy wife had a house red ($7) - table wine at best, sweet grape juice at worst. \n\nSo I pull a half-star for the semi-miss on the entree and a full one for price.

Although it has become more of a restaurant than brewpub when they removed the pool table/relaxing area and made more seating; it's still a great place to sit and talk, catch up with old(or make new) friends, or watch the game. \nThe Raj IPA is my personal favorite but Kiltlifer and HopKnot are other local favorites. First time there? Get their sampler and decide for yourself, their seasonals are also excellent! Happy hour (regular and reverse) are definitely the time to go for $ deals, but be warned this is a popular hangout for regulars. \nFour Peaks food was a lot better a couple of years ago, but their flavors are still well done. My fav starter or small bite is their spinach-artichoke dip that comes with beer bread (small pita bites made with beer) and tortilla chips. Perfect to share with one or two people. My favorite main dish is the salmon BLT but check out their specials online ahead of time before heading in, these are usually delicious things you can't find on the menu. \nAnother thing that's not on their menu is grilled cheese. I know, as simple as it may seem theirs is delicious and goes great with their soup of the day for something a little less filling.

Not worth driving there from far at all.\nThere were about 10 food stall where you could sample the food from and they ranged from A-OK to Terrible. There were many stalls selling essential oils for aromatherapy, protein supplements, massagers. \nThere were some selling gourmet organic food stuff; coffee, olive oils, tapenades, jams, sauces, jellies, nuts, wonderfoods, honey, wax, tea etc.\n\nWe had a small Caeser cocktail sounded great (with potato vodka and walter's caeser mix; i love walter's caeser mix) which turned out to be terrible. There was a lot of black pepper mixed with a little salt kind of glued on the rim. It killed the drink as well as my taste buds for the rest of the day. We tried the Chicken paella which was uncooked. The vegetable samosas were okay but tiny and expensive for the price.\nWe loved the Riesling from Megalomaniac, it was very fresh and earthy; perfect for a summery afternoon. We tried Pinot noir from Rosewood Estate which was good too. The belgian waffles were good, they were topped with whipped cream, maple, raspberry sauce.\n\nI'll pass next time. Would have preferred a lazy sunday afternoon rather.",

I tried a sample and it tasted freezer burnt, so I chose a flavor that looked like it moves quickly. Service could certainly be improved upon. After eating outside, we went into the bathroom to wash my son's hands. Now, I've been in dirty bathrooms, but I definitely didn't expect to find one here. I've worked in restaurants that didn't maintain their bathrooms, but it takes a certain level of neglect to build up dust in the pee, around the back of the toilet, the sink. Come on! There was a super strong air freshener that you could literally rate when you walked in, which managed to cover up what just have been a pretty bad smell. Makes me completely distrust the cleanliness of the rest of the restaurant, as well as management in general. I think next time I'll just go to Terrible's and get a Toll House.",

The 2 stars represents the wonderful atmosphere, the preserved history AND how wonderful the very famous Balzac's is in the greater scheme of the entire Distillery District. \n\nThere are a couple of points if like to discuss briefly , or to mention. First, I have no idea WHY this beautiful building, especially as locals and tourists alone are there to use there cameras in this great Victorian industry, that NO PHOTOS ARE PERMITTED . \n\nThe only other places where you really should not take photos is a gallery - that makes sense, they I can appreciate . But for The most illogical and bizarre reason(s), taking PHOTOGRAPHS IN THIS PUBLIC space is a definite no, no. I literally have no idea why you cannot take photographs inside what is essentially nothing more than a coffee shop. I would LOVE to find out the rationale, even though I have seen countless people thinking to themselves, \"why can't I photograph this beautiful Victorian space, the architecture, the original fixtures, the beautiful staircase among all kinds of wonderful and interesting items designed for it TO be seen , and take photos regardless. \n\nSecond, the coffee is exceptionally tar-sands thick and tasteless no matter how much sugar you add to a coffee. Don't get me wrong, you are in the Distillery and prices are higher, so let's understand that. But in talking with other visitors,there has at times been agreements that McDonalds or Tim Hortons has far far better coffee. I'm not sure if this is a very traditional way of roasting coffee, which if it is, I can understand. It may be me, but I've heard other visitors with the same opinion. Anyways. \n\nRest assured, it's a definite stop in the Distillery for its own sake. Again, and I've seen employees SAY BLUNTLY to tourists, no cameras are allowed to their utter confusion of people from other parts outside of Toronto visiting. What is this place, the Vatican Archives? \n\nSo be aware of that, pictures are taken by so many individuals because of its rustic beauty. Why else do you think that people want to come to the Distillery? Something you could always ask if you are forced to put your travellers' cameras away. \n\nPrices are generally higher but still I would recommend a visit to Balzac's just to sit back in the sun on the patio and watch the world go by. The desserts offered are varied but I want to positively review that their parties, donuts , various other good things to eat with coffee ARE DELICIOUS. Do t forget the seating loft section on the second floor as its a great retreat space, relaxing and with a nice view of architecture you cannot photograph.",

Then something happened - ownership change? corporate mandates? whatever it was, Smashburger changed almost overnight.  2 years ago we had a horrible experience at the Baseline location. A year ago another horrible experience at the Alma School location. Thinking this new location on Elliot might be different, I went again today. I got their new Sin City Burger, Sweet Potato Fries and Salted Caramel Shake all to go. The service was decent, the cashier was quick and efficient but not friendly at all. I got my food quick and drove home. While the sweet potato fries were pretty crisp and not very greasy, the burger was the exact opposite. It was soggy, greasy and super salty. I guess that's what I get for ordering a burger with a fried egg in it but I was not expecting the sogginess or the saltyness. Then came the shake, which I did not think you could ruin. It was good until I hit the bottom and found a couple of...not sure what they were, globs of something at the bottom that tasted bitter. I immediately spit it out and was done. I had a coupon so it wasn't that bad of a price, but the food was not great. I'd take The Habit or Five Guys over Smashburger now. Oh well, live and learn.",

It isn't great but it isn't horrible. It's the same quality as other chain Japanese restaurants. I had spicy miso ramen, which lacked in spiciness but had a good flavor. It lacked in substance though. They could really dress up the ramen other than few strands of seaweed, little bit of sweet corn tossed in and handful of bean sprouts. \n\nThe rolls were okay. Spicy albacore left a lot of spicy to be desired, salmon was fatty and good, just lacked a lot of flavor. The eel was tough and overcooked, not to mention there were still bones so I had to be careful with it. \n\nService was good. The waitress was fast and very polite. Definitely good service.\n\nI sat at the sushi bar with my boyfriend and let's talk about the sushi chefs. There were 3 working while I was there, Oscar, Sam and Josh. Oscan was hispanic and Sam and Josh were Korean (I promise this will matter in just a minute). I was so offended and disgusted with Josh's behavior. I'm Korean myself and speak the language fluently. I guess Josh assumed I didn't because he and Sam were speaking in Korean and Josh REPEATEDLY cursed and called Sam a derogatory name. Oscar of course did not speak Korean and when he said something to Josh (nothing bad, just about the food), Josh called him another derogatory name in Korean. I could tell from their interaction Oscar was used to Josh saying something to him in Korean and not knowing what it was. Josh just kept talking like that to his coworkers, even going into his dislike for the current job. I came to enjoy a nice lunch. Did I have to sit there and listen to this? I don't care if you think I don't speak Korean. The fact that the chef can stand there in front of customers and belittle his coworkers and talk like that is completely disrespectful. Not to mention there was another couple at the sushi bar and he talked about them as well. \n\nAn employee was refilling my drink and he was not dressed like the wait staff so I asked if he was the manager and he said he was. I told him I didn't appreciate having to eat my lunch in an environment where the chef is cursing throughout my lunch and he said he will talk to them. He didn't even ask me which chef it was and instead, right in front of me, asked to see Sam. Sam went behind the curtain with the manager and within seconds, Josh followed Sam. They all came back less than a minute later and that was it. Sam and Josh was smiling and laughing when they came back to behind the bar.\n\nThis was truly an absurd lunch.

That's where I draw the line. Its one thing to have certain rules but completely another reason to discriminate and lie to your customers. But its ok, we ended up going to another place in the area which was just as well rated and spent our money there. Thought of complaining to management at first, but in the end realized that they're punishing themselves with this attitude. There are plenty of nice restaurant and bars in the area who don't treat their customers like this.",

The stupidity was that I was in Vegas and I thought must of been dreaming that I was down the Old Kent Road. I got round bits of reconstituted ham that they call Canadian Bacon, oddly, since its neither Canadian nor bacon, and furthermore quite possibly doesn't even come from a pig.  Maybe the Bellagio financed that recently announced stem cell research where they grew white meat and had to add colouring for the tasting.  All the journo's hated it.\n\nThe sausages were anaemic looking white things that the waiter told me was a mixture of sausage meat and turkey meat.  The menu called them bangers.  Now any self-respecting Brit knows what a banger is and this certainly wasn't one.  I think they might have been made from the scraps from the meat factory floor, which of course bangers are, but at least they're the right sort of scraps.\n\nI chose fried eggs because then at least you can see 3 separate eggs rather than have an omelette made from a 100 gallon drum of eggs which is how many of these industrial kitchens buy their eggs (BTW Michael Pollan told me that).  Unfortunately these eggs were so under done that that I could hardly eat them.\n\nFrom this point on things got much better.  My waiter, Anando, saw my forlorn expression and offered to change it after I'd done my best to eat a little - my mother never let us reject anything on the plate.  We swapped it for an omelette, which was ok'ish but he also went off in serach of numerous expressi for me - there machine was down.  In fact Anando was such a charming guy that he turned me from a grumpy, whinging pom to a bright and cheerful chappie by the time i left.  Despite all his efforts, however, I can't bring myself to give the place more than a 1.",

Favorite part of our meal was the mound of Truffle Fries although it could've used more Truffle Oil. Bone in Filet Mignon, a massive portion, was cooked perfectly medium rare. Regular Filet Mignon on the other hand was overcooked and dry with no pink. Lobster Mac & Cheese felt overload with the Velveeta-ish cheese and no trace of lobster. Enjoyed the medley of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms much more. Signature Sea Bass with Truffle Butter Crust, Shitake Mushrooms, and Asparagus was a very nice light meal, cooked perfectly. Sea Bass was moist, the crust was flavorful though it could've used a bit more Truffle oil as well. Overall, enjoyed the excellent service and certain aspects of our meal.",

There were plenty of reservation times available at the last minute, and we were seated right away upon our arrival. \n\nThe atmosphere is very nice. There are candles and dimmed lighting, so very romantic and warm. It's also a pretty small restaurant, adding to the European feel.\n\nWe ordered:\n-Soft shell crab / Beef carpaccio: I wasn't a big fan of the soft shell crab. When the appetizer came out, all I could smell was crab/fish. Fresh seafood typically does not smell like seafood... I also thought the crab didn't have much flavor. The asparagus and the cream sauce on the bottom had excellent flavor though. The menu lists \"San Marzano flavors\" for that dish, so perhaps I am just not familiar with that flavor. My boyfriend's carpaccio though, was delicious. I loved the combination of the beef, arugula, and cheese. I wish they hadn't dropped the two slices of cheese on top though; I think it would've been better presentation to see the carpaccio.\n\n-Tagleatelle & seafood / Corvina: My pasta was a little overcooked, and the shrimp didn't taste very fresh. The scallops were tasty though. Overall, I thought the dish didn't have very much interesting flavors. Not something I would remember and be interested in going back for. My bf's corvina was the same way. Sauteed spinach is hard to flavor sometimes, and I thought it kind of brought down the whole dish. The capers were a flavorful touch, but not enough. Again, not that exciting.\n\n-Tiramisu / Crema tostata: Dessert was delicious. Although anything with enough sugar is good. I would come back just for these two and a cup of coffee.\n\nService was excellent, atmosphere is warm and romantic. But the food was just... barely mediocre. Sad.",

The seats were wide but shallow and incredibly uncomfortable.  Our table mates had to stand and constantly readjust, and it became a joke throughout the night as we watched other guests squirm in their chairs for relief.  Our server rushed us to get drink orders in, but I asked for time since we were sharing the one cocktail/wine menu among the table.  I had to remind the server about my drink order and waited an additional 15 minutes for my glass of wine to arrive.\n\nWe ordered the meat, cheese, and pickle tray as well as pretzel brioche for appetizers.  The pretzel brioche and whipped butters were good, but no one ever told us what the butters were.  We figured out one was mustard, one honey, and the one in the middle was a mystery butter.  There were very few pickles on our plate (one slice of jalapeno for example) and we had to ask for more bread.  In addition, I didn't like two of the three cheeses that were served, and I can't say that has ever happened to me before.  Our friends ordered two entrees to share, scallops and lamb, and the server left before taking the order for the other half of the table.  We had to call our server back to order.  My boyfriend and I shared the sticky pork shank and sides of brussel sprouts and crispy fingerling potatoes.  I enjoyed the pork shank more than my boyfriend did and the brussel sprouts were not crispy like I would have preferred.  All in all, we could have prepared a better version of this meal at home.\n\nIf the food was amazing and the service lackluster, I may have been able to overlook the deficits of this restaurant.  However, when a shared meal costs over a hundred dollars (in Charlotte no less), I expect the food to wow me and the service to be up to standard.  As a former server in a Michelin star restaurant, I know what level of service to expect and what is unacceptable.  For example when spending $150 on dinner for two, I expect the silverware to not be placed in a pile with the napkins at the end of the table.\n\nUnfortunately, we will not be back to Stoke.",

My overall rating is 2 stars as I have averaged my two visits. \n\nVISIT #1:  4 STARS\nMy first visit was great.

The decor was lovely and upscale, the server was fast, the bill came and we were happy to pay it. Great overall experience.  \n\nVISIT #2:   0 STARS\nWent back for Charlotte Restaurant Week Jan 2014. NIGHTMARE! We made reservations for the Saturday night way in advance and even showed up a little early. We had another couple coming in from out of town and thought it would be a nice place to go with them. NOPE. The place was slammed with people waiting out the door. I think the whole town of Cornelius was there. Our reservation was for 8pm. We got seated at 9:30pm. Not good. And we were seated in this no atmosphere overflow room in the back with two huge groups next to us. He was like \"where are we? Is this still Alton's Kitchen?\"  No server for miles, finally ordered at 10pm. Our guests are now pissed off and this restaurant is ruining our evening. When the dinner finally arrives at almost 11pm, the food is not hot and just mediocre (he got the ribs again and wasn't impressed). The others in our party wanted to order another drink so they could have it with their dinner. NO SERVER FOR MILES AGAIN. So they just sat there, waiting for the server to come as their dinner got cold. She arrived when the rest of us finished dinner and got them a drink so they could eat. It was really uncomfortable and we haven't seen them since. I was embarrassed to have taken them there. Is it my fault for going during Restaurant Week craziness and expecting a decent meal? Or is it Alton's Kitchen's fault for overbooking their restaurant, going over capacity, and not having enough staff? My questions may never be answered, but one this is for sure- I'm never going back and will never recommend this place.  \n\nTO ALTON'S KITCHEN: Charlotte Restaurant Week Summer edition is next month.

It's not her bedside manner that I have any problem with, it's much more about her ability to listen to her patients' owners and give credence to their observations and concerns.\n\nWe have an elderly cat named Buster, who started losing weight and drinking and urinating excessively. From prior experience with another cat, we knew these symptoms could be signs of kidney disease, a fairly common issue with older male cats. We took Buster to see Dr. Pederson, and asked if she would check him for kidney disease. She diagnosed him with dental problems (which, to be fair, was a common issue for Buster, and a contributing factor to his health problems) Dr. Pederson told me that she needed to do a couple of extractions and then he would be fine. Since the dental problems were ongoing, and he had very few teeth left, we told her to just remove the remaining teeth, as they were not going to be of any use, and we didn't want to put an elderly cat under anesthesia any more than we had to. She didn't.\n\nWhen I looked at his surgical bloodwork I saw that his kidney values were elevated, and pointed this out to her. She shrugged it off and said that it was a result of the dental problems.\n\nI asked if we should re-check his blood work in a week or two to confirm her diagnosis, and she again brushed off my suggestion and said we should wait another 4 months until his annual checkup to re-check the kidney numbers. I had my doubts, but because she seemed very nice and competent, I agreed, and did not seek a second opinion. \n\nA month later, Buster is dropping weight in a drastic fashion and we took him back to Dr. Pederson and demanded that the bloodwork be run. As expected, he was in early stage kidney failure, a process that cannot be reversed, but could have been slowed had we begun treatment when we first brought him in. We begin his treatment and he responds well.\n\nAnother month later and we must leave town for a combination of work travel and a friend's wedding. Dr. Pederson suggested letting us board Buster with them at Advanced, and we would run another kidney screen while he was in. We later get a call from another doctor we've never met, asking why he's got Buster, and why we are running the bloodwork. Dr. Pederson had left town without giving him any information on what was going on with the current boarders and no ability to access their medical records.\n\nThat was the last time we took Buster to Advanced.\n\nNow, 5 months later, and Buster's dental issues have returned, because a) she didn't remove the teeth we requested, and b) she didn't remove all the roots of the teeth she did extract. This is extremely frustrating as this situation is exactly what we wanted to avoid when we asked her to take all of his teeth. \n\nI cannot stress enough how upset we were with Dr. Pederson and her unwillingness to respect our knowledge of our cat and wishes for his care.",

There are next times to try other posh places anyway. For tourists who's not really looking for the glit and lush of fine dining, this one's a wise choice. They have  promos like \"come in any time from purchase til 6pm\" and youre good to go.\n\nI hope they read this and they set another line for those with the pink tags, coz by the time you come back, like @ 5-6pm theyre really packed, line is long--and returnees are confused whether they should still fall in line or just show their tags to get seated. \n\nRound table buffet is wise---In VegaS it would be impossible to roam in just one area, probably by the time u'd like to avail their promo youre already at the other end of the strip so by the time youre promo ends, youd scram all the way back-- or probably not make it.\n\nBut were wiser.",

        "text": "I wish it were possible to give negative stars.  What a terrible dining experience!\n\nMy husband and I just moved to Ahwatukee, and we're visiting restaurants in the area in an effort to find new favorite spots.  This past weekend, my mother was in town and we wanted to take her out for a nice meal.  Coming from Scottsdale, we were big fans of Fogo de Chao and we were excited to learn that the Brazilian Bull was a similar establishment.  Boy, were we wrong!\n\nWe went for dinner at 730 on a Friday night, and the place was half empty - which should have been the first sign of trouble.  The waiter was very pleasant and explained the concept to my mother, who has never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before.  For the cost of $33/person we would have access to the salad bar and all we could eat meat. Drinks and desserts were extra.  Knowing we wanted to save room for meat, we each grabbed one plate at the salad bar.  I had a devilled egg, some mushrooms, balsamic veggies, and a couple of shrimp.  My husband and mother had similar plates, all with room to spare.  None of us tried the hot options, which included some sort of stew and meatloaf.  The salad bar was okay, nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about.  It's obviously much less of a variety than Fogo de Chao, but what we ate was decent.\n\nNone of us finished our entire salad plates, just tasted a bit here and there as we wanted to save room for the meats.  When the meat came around, we were brought pork, chicken, and sausage.  All three meats were extremely over-cooked and dry.  They brought us fried bananas, and they were cold (I'm not talking about luke-warm, I mean COLD).  It was clear the food had been cooked some time ago.  After one bite of pork and sausage (the chicken didn't even look appetizing), we knew this was not going to work.  We have never asked for our money back, but we knew the quality of this food was not worth $33/person.  We quietly explained to our waiter our concerns, and he went outside to get his manager.\n\nWhen the manager arrived at our table, she was defensive and argumentative.  We were being very polite and explained the food was not very good.  She proceeded to go off on the fact that we had only received the first round of meat, and we should try more.  We didn't enjoy what we had (it was honestly comparable to beef jerkey!), and we didn't want to try more and have to pay for bad food.  She continued on a tangent about how the meat is not over-cooked, but rather cooked minimally at first, then after each round of serving customers it is placed back in the fire.  Well, wouldn't that make it over-cooked with time?  My husband apparently made a face when hearing this and she scolded him before offering us a mere 10% off.  I managed to keep my cool, and explained we would not be eating anything else and we would not be paying for the meat; however, we would be glad to pay for our salad and drinks.  She stormed off to the kitchen, never once offering an apology.\n\nWe sat there for a good 5-10 minutes, waiting for our bill.  It was a very awkward and bizarre experience, since all of the wait staff starred at us.  When the manager came back, she brought us a bill for $58.  Yep, you read that right -  3 small plates of salad bar, 1 iced tea and 1 diet coke (Mom had water), cost us $58.  I refused to pay that.  The manager proceeded to get louder, and my mom asked her to keep her voice down because we did not want to make a scene in front of their other paying customers.  (How insane is that?!  We were the ones trying to prevent the manager from making a scene!)  Apparently she felt we should be charged for the salad bar only, which was well over $15 for dinner.  I refused.  She then said we could just stay and eat the meat for $33/person, including the salad bar.  I refused again.  She then said we could pay $9.99 person for salad, which is their lunch cost.  Wanting the awful Brazilian Bull experience to end, we gave them $30.  We honestly should have stormed out of there and paid nothing after being treated so poorly, but we're good people.\n\nThe food was terrible, and the customer service was even worse.  I'm not sure if the manager is an owner, but she was the rudest person I have ever encountered.  Not once did she appear apologetic for our dissatisfaction, instead she was defensive, argumentative and hostile.  I would warn all others before going here, save your money.  This is no Fogo de Chao.  Heck, it isn't even on par with McDonald's.\n\nWe ended up eating across the street at the pizza place. It was awesome, but we were disappointed it wasn't the nice dinner we wanted to treat Mom to.  Lesson learned, I will trust my fellow Yelpers going forward!\n\nUPDATE: I would like to add that shortly after I posted this, a five star review was posted by Marco in NJ.  When I edited my review to mention that recent reviews were from NJ, his location changed to Phoenix.  Untrustworthy!!",

I ordered the Cajun seasoned broiled Mayflower Platter. It consisted of Fillet of Flounder, Alaskan White Fish Fillet, Sea Scallops, Jumbo Shrimp, & Fried Deviled Crab. The seafood itself was very bland. You could see the Cajun seasoning but there was a serious lack of flavor. It desperately needed salt. Thankfully I had some homemade salad that I could eat it with so that really helped me out. They had a picture of the mayflower platter on their website and my seafood looked nowhere as succulent as theirs did. My shrimp were definitely not Jumbo - even though the description says it. They were more like medium 41/50. What a rip off. The scallops were sweet but small too. The fish fillets were thin and you can tell they were all frozen. Not fresh. \n\nI did try a couple of the hushpuppies and those were not bad at all. And the deviled crab did not taste like crab. I couldn't even see any crab in it. It was just all breading.\n\nI did receive a side salad and steamed broccoli with my platter. I didn't eat the salad since I had my own but when I went to eat it the next day, it was all watery and brown. So that was a no. But the broccoli was cooked well, flavorless but I added salt. \n\nOverall - I would not entertain the idea of eating here again.",

I managed to drink a cup of coffee and have the standard breakfast burrito before the Walrus drove me way and so did the Canadian visitors reveling in my AZ sunshine. The almost 6 buck burrito wasn't really worth half that price, but the burro was good enough for a small meal and the coffee (mostly dark choices) were average.

We checked in with the pool staff and we were taken to the chairs I had reserved. It was only 11:30 and there was hardly anyone there yet. So we waited a few minutes and a waitress never came over to us to get drink orders so my husband just got up and went to the bar. While my husband was doing that, the waitress finally came over. Before even indroducing herself she says \"ummm did you pay for these?\" And said \"yes, for these 2.\" She then says \"so, you gave one of the guys over there money for these??\" And I said \"no. I purchased them online. But I already checked in with one of the guys up there\". She then says \"oh. Well what can I get for you\". I told her my husband had already went to the bar but I'm sure we will be needed refills soon. She then walks away.\nAfter awhile, we were ready to order more drinks. She never came up to us. I had to flag her down.  Thought the day, she paid attention to EVERYONE around us, but completely ignored us! During lunch time, everyone had menus, but us. The girl next to me had to tell the waitress to bring me a menu! I could understand if this was a crazy pool party that was super crowded, but it wasn't. She completely went out of her way to ignore us. \nMy husband and I are really good tippers since I used to be a waitress...so this chick blew it! We only tipped her $8.00 on a $120 check. And that is something we NEVER do, so you know it had to be bad! In the future, we will not be going to this pool.",

Red team and blue team cooking just like the show. The food was absolutely delicious, and the staff's service was superb. Reservations are highly recommended.\n\nThe pan seared scallop appetizer was very delicious and fresh. I highly recommend the beef Wellington. It was very soft and tender. The potatoe puree, glazed veggies, and red wine sauce were a very good touch. My husband ordered the crispy skin salmon, and that was amazing as well. It was cooked very well. The skin was very crisp and the fish was not dry at all. You could cut it gently with a fork.\n\nWe were really full from the dinner portions and did not have room for dessert, but I would also like to comment on the drinks we ordered. I had the watermelon mocktail and it was very sweet but refreshing. My husband ordered the rim donkey. FYI, push the flame passion fruit into the drink fast with the straw. My husband struggled a bit with this and set his first straw on fire. The straw of course melted :D, and he had to get another one. It was really funny to watch at his expense.",

I am not a hard person to please so when I say that the service was bad then it was BAD. I am usually quite content with my service when I go out to restaurants or bars.\n\nMyself, my boyfriend and a couple of other friends decided to come here for drinks and appetizers last night. First of all, there was NO waiter/waitress serving us so we had to order everything at the bar. When my boyfriend and I went to the bar to order 2 rum and cokes at the bar we weren't acknowledged at all! Not even a simple \"hey guys I'll be with you shortly\" NOTHING. The bartender was too busy flirting it up with all the single women. And us being a couple, we weren't being served. We are just as much of guests as anyone. After 5 minutes of waiting, we finally decided to go to the bar on the upper floor. We were served RIGHT away. We were happy.\n\nSo once we finished our drinks. I offered to buy us another round. My boyfriend stayed at the table, as I went to the bar. I went to the same guy thinking that hopefully he would serve me. I approached the bar, and I said \"whenever you're ready can I please have 2 rum and cokes\" in a very polite tone and a smile. He responded with, \"I am serving the ladies right now\". I couldn't believe it. But I already placed my order, so I wasnt going to leave at this point. I FINALLY got my drinks after he flirted with the single women (very poorly may I add). I did not tip him, and I'm usually a generous tipper. \n\nTime for round #3, the whole table wanted rum and cokes so I went upstairs because I was not going back to the same bartender. I got my rum and cokes right away. I was happy! I tipped him and thanked him. Because I had multiple drinks I had to put them on a tray. As I was downstairs, I lost my balance of the tray and the drinks split. I didnt want to go back upstairs so I asked the horrible bartender on my floor if he could kindly pour me a new set of drinks. He refused. I finally said \"You have been a horrible bartender all night\" and then he said \"well youve been a shitty customer all night\". The bouncer (being his friend) also said Ive been a shitty customer, a girl that worked there also was being rude to me. I couldnt believe it. \n\nNEVER in my life have I been spoken to like that by someone working at a restaurant. I have worked at multiple restaurants and if I ever talked to a customer like that I could pretty much kiss my job goodbye. Yet these people are getting away with it.\n\nThe only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because the venue is good and the live music is also good. But other than that I would not recommend anyone coming here.\n\nALSO, if multiple people are complaining about the service then the owner really should have better judgement on who he is hiring.",

I found out on my own and stopped in to grab what I needed.  I walked in and there were two women that worked there, both applying makeup on two customers.  I was literally a few feet away from one of the makeup artists, yet I didn't even get a \"hello\" or \"I'll be right with you\".  I stood there for almost 10 minutes, which is a REALLY long time when you are being ignored.  FINALLY, one of the girls asked me what she could help me with.

I was impressed with their wings and prices and the amazing service. In the past year they have extremely went down hill. My wings have been over done and some cooked to the point where the meat is so dry and then covered in their golden sauce to hide their over cooked meat. I thought maybe it was a off night but I've been back a couple times and same thing. I began ordering chicken skewers and they have went from chicken fingers on a stick to chicken nuggets on a stick. I tried the zips by my house in Arcadia and same thing! The service had even become slower. My waitress checked on us once and we counted 5 times she's was chilling up by the bar shooting the shit with the other waitresses. The place wasn't even slammed and we waited 40 min for wings? I've never waited more then 20 min on a busy night. Looks like I will be taking my wing business elsewhere. I am not sure what changed but I hope they go back to whatever they were doing.",

        "text": "Honestly, I kinda feel tricked....\n\nI love how Johnny Cakes website looks - it's like a happy medium of a retro and modern flair. It's enticing with the bold colors and the hot retro looking chick. The photos of their creations looked yummy and with the announcement that \"Due to a high demand from college students they will be open on Sundays and closed on Mondays\" I knew I had to make my short treck up to Anthem to try them out. \n\nThey are located right next to one of my fav Sushi spots En Sushi. I walked in to a large empty bakery space with some small cupcakes on display in a case and 3 glass dishes filled with cookies. I love baked goods and I knew right away none of these items were freshly made today. I asked the lady if they had any breakfast pastries and she said they only make them sometimes and that they really didn't sell when they were made anyways. She did say that due to the holidays their big sellers were the cookies and their cupcake bouquets. \n\nI asked if they were making any pies and she asked the chef (owner I think) and he said yes for $14.95 each. Yikes, I think thats a bit highly priced. She wanted to know if I wanted anything and I said I'll try 2 cupcakes and a cookie. Honestly, if the items looked fresh I would've bought more. But I figured I made the trip so I should try something. \nThe cupcakes were priced at $2.50 each and were rather small. Some of them were even deformed (lopsided) but still in the case to be sold. Not good \"presentation wise\". They should see the cupcakes sold for $2.65 at Retro Bakery - thats how they should look. \nI choose the Blueberry,Bacon/Maple cupcakes and a spice cookie with white chocolate in the middle. The cookie was very hard and the lady said the middle should be soft due to the white chocolate middle - Nope, the white chocolate was hard as well.\nThe Blueberry cupcake was very cold and the frosting was hard - due to being refrigerated for IDK how long.... So I let that one sit a little.\nWhen it finally thawed out a little it was alright.\nThe Maple Bacon was just gross to me.... Now, the lady did warn me that the Maple cake is not soft like the other cupcakes but I thought \"How hard could cake really be?\" Well, it didn't matter how long I let it sit cause the cake was just too tough- the frosting with the Maple syrup was just sugar overload. I threw this cupcake out!!!\n\nNow, maybe I went on an off day for them.... Maybe it was just my bad luck..... I was just so disappointed because I wanted to like them so much. Hell, I even shared on my FB wall a picture of their Spam Cupcakes for all my friends and family to see. I've never owned or ran a Bakery but I would think that on each day that I'm open for buisness I would have something fresh made on that day for sell and if I'm open during breakfast time a breakfast pastry would make sense.\n \nI think there located in a good area in Anthem in which it's right near many homes where the majority of the community if not all are well to do but if you don't have on hand a little variety of frsh yummy stuff to buy then people will drive elsewhere like to Bread and Butter down the street where everthing is made fresh daily. I wish Johnny Cakes well because I do like there concept but it just needs a better execution.",

        "text": "2-1/2 stars\n\nI have been here a few times on very different occasions with mixed reviews.\nLocated in the heart of the financial district the place is like an urban oasis. It's the only stand-alone restaurant in the area with a great expansive patio.  South of Temperance scored a long term lease so there's no need to worry that it will be torn down for a condo or office building anytime soon.\nThe upscale Hooters comments here on yelp is a good analogy, which is not a bad thing.\n\nWEDDING:\nI helped a friend with his wedding reception which was held here, and it proved to be a great venue, especially on a weekend where the area is more relaxed and is very quiet from the work crowd. Tom, which I think is the manager of the restaurant was very nice and accomodating in helping with the reception -- a pleasure to work with. The restaurant handled the food for the wedding flawlessly and the dinner was well prepared and tasted good -- I typically find wedding food to be rather mediocre, but not here. The little desserts that they offered was rather lack luster and seemed to be either from frozen or made off-site, no biggie as the star should be the wedding cake.\nThe wait staff, looking hot as always, were attentive, friendly and upbeat. They made sure that water and wine were often replenished.\n\nLUNCH:\nForgo the patio on a windy day. With nearby construction, the downtown wind tunnel effect made for an unpleasant meal outside as dust, dirt and debris is thrown in all directions and the furniture gets a little dirty.\nFood was good. The fish tacos are great and I really like the cobb sandwich -- hard boiled egg inside a grilled panini is a tasty combination.\nService was a tad slow with the hoardes of Bay Street lunch crowd -- best to go for an early or late lunch. \n\nAFTER WORK:\nMy last visit was less than stellar. The doorman at the entrance of the patio almost refused to let me in because of their dress code. I was dressed very sharp in all black (not out of place with the other people there), but the doorman noticed my shoes. I wore a pair of custom designed black and red leather Jack Percells, which didn't look too casual or like running shoes and I always get compliments everywhere I go. Unfortunately the doorman didn't appreciate my progressive style eventhough I arrived with a group of friends who knew this doorman.  He let me in with a warning.\n\nInside the restaurant and patio I did noticed a few people wearing canvas Chuck Taylors and one wearing flip flops amongst the sharp-, tired- and pretensious-looking suit crowd, so the dress code seems rather loose here. Ironically one of the waitresses complimented me on my shoes.\n\nThe place gets really busy after work and you could imagine the bar being packed with thirsty after work patrons. There is a bit of a wait at the bar, but the wait staff are trying their best to keep up with the crowd and applaud them for keeping a good attitude and being appreciative.\n\nOn the way out the doorman told me to wear better shoes next time. I didn't know if the doorman was playing with me or was being a pompous dick, but either way that kind of attitude is not acceptable to any of their customers. I knock off a star because of the ignorant doorman.\nWest end hipsters be warned: best to enter through the main entrance rather than the patio entrance to avoid the doorman nonsense.",

Maybe a quarter of an inch thick, with cheap cheese that melted into liquid grease. 100% unappetizing, and they wanted to charge three dollars for a single one. No sides or anything.\n\nMeanwhile I got their Thursday $5 special, the carne asada. It at least had a proper portion size. But the meat was chewy and tasted almost old. Beans tasted pretty good, but rice was very mediocre. The waitress insisted that everything is fresh and they go to the market every morning for supplies. If that's the case, then they've figured out how to take fresh ingredients and capture that mysterious and elusive 'slightly outdated' flavor that's so hard to achieve with fresh food. I only managed two or three bites before giving up.\n\nThe chips were alright but nothing amazing. We got two rounds of them, and the second round tasted fresher than the first. Salsa was alright-ish but lacked sophistication, and had a slight burn in the back of the throat that managed to drag on and on. Top this off with the water tasting either like tap or like their filter had gone out. We both drank from my tea, just to mask the dubiousness.\n\nSo far this is completely in 'Eek!' territory, so why 2 stars instead of 1? The waitress that day was great. But she's apparently one of the bartenders and was just covering for the Maribel's staff today while they were short. She was extremely understanding, and took off both the terrible enchilada and the disappointing carne asada. We left without being charged, but we still happily left a tip.\n\nAnd really, there were other patrons here who seemed to be quite happy with what they were getting, so I'm very confused about how lousy this was for us. I remember reading over these yelp reviews and wondering how you end up seeing a bunch of 4 and 5 star ratings and then an intermittent 1 or 2. I've definitely had a 1 or 2 experience today.

But nothing works right at Nobu hotel. \n\nChecked in, promised welcome tea never delivered. Toilet stuck flushing until you jiggle the handle. Dead batteries in the bathroom weight scale (not a bad thing on vacation, but come on...) Calling room service lead to being forwarded to five different people before being instructed to hang up and try again. TV fades heavily dark to bright again. TV controls highly glitchy. Internet service doesn't work much.\n\nWorst thing was we could hear every word of every conversation in the next door room at night. They were talking at a normal level. Hotel must have installed cheap walls during the Nobu remodel. It gets worse when your neighbors watch TV or listen to music when you are trying to sleep. \n\nOn the other less noisy wall I noticed I could see the feet and shadows of the guests in that room under the door connecting the two independent hotel rooms. There is no bottom seal on the door! I expect that in some motels/hotels, but we thought this hotel was supposed to be nice.\n\nAfter check-in, noticed the microfridge was locked. Asked them to unlock when ordering room service. They said the remote switch wasn't working and they would have the room service unlock when food is delivered. When the room service guy arrived 45 mins later, he had not heard about it. He said he would have to go get a key or tool. 15 mins later he came back to unlock it. I could finally drink that $70 300ml sake, but our meal was just about over. Too slow, too late. (The sake was good however :)\n\nWe visit Vegas at least twice a year and don't spend too much time in the hotel room. But in this hotel it was really uncomfortable when we finally decided to go to bed. Beyond the noise problem, the air conditioner pumps a cold parching dry breeze right over your face all night long. When the AC shuts down every now and then it makes a putt putt putt motor noise. On the second night we woke up to occasional stale cigarette smoke smells a few times. We were in a non smoking room so maybe came through the AC or through the crack under the door.\n\nWithout a doubt a lower cost standard room at a generic big casino hotel will give you a better experience than Nobu. I think they cut the budget and scaled back on everything recently. Maybe Nobu just wasn't pulling in profit after the initial opening or something. It has become an awful hotel. I read early reviews that said Nobu gives tooth brushes like hotels in Japan. They don't do this anymore. \n\nNext trip it will be back to the Vegas Four Seasons, our favorite. For the price, a much better hotel with larger and quieter rooms. Also, the Nobu restaurant was nothing special. Kumi in Mandalay Bay hotel has much much better Japanese food with flavors that simply explode with delight in your mouth. Nobu food is good, but nothing special. For the price, you can do much better in Vegas.\n\nDisappointed. Oh, I also forgot to mention there was a messy room cleaning cart parked outside of our room door during the length of our two night stay. Right in front of the door. And dirty rags on the ledge right outside our room window. Not much of a view anyway, but please at least pick up the dirty rags.\n\nNo luxury or comfort here. Look elsewhere. Individually the staff were nice and wanting to be helpful. They seem to be well aware of the decay and constantly apologetic in nature. \n\nThe second star is for the location, being the only thing good about Nobu Vegas.",

It was crowded when we arrived, so we opted to sit at a table in the bar thinking we would get faster service and be able to keep up with the World Series on the screens. It took a few minutes for our server to approach us, but she was friendly when she did finally greet us. We ordered drinks which then took 20+ minutes to arrive even though we were at a table adjacent to the bar. Thinking they were shorthanded, I watched as the 3 bartenders yucked it up with the servers around the bar making martinis. When she finally came back, we ordered salads and dinner. We didn't see her again for a while, but finally ordered another round of drinks once our salads arrived...which took another 20+ minutes. Another customer across from our table was obviously complaining to a mgr during our wait, so clearly they weren't having a good night at Firebirds. Dinner finally arrived and we gave up on drinks and had water. We asked for and paid the check the next time I spotted the server. I asked her why the service was so slow and she responded \"she really didn't know, but maybe it was because they had happy hour?\" I asked what was included in happy hour and she explained \"house drinks and half price appetizers\"...who knew? We paid for our full price drinks and dinner ($100) and left. On the way out, the hostess asked how was dinner to which I responded \"unusually slow\". The mgr was standing there and said \"we are still learning\". What an unusual comment and clearly without a care that it will be a longgggg time before we ever return. Oh well, lesson learned! Poor service and customer relations for a restaurant that could easily have done a better job!",

        "text": "A couple weeks ago I was cooking on my glass stove top.  I heard a very loud pop and noticed a number of cracks in the glass after removing a pot from the stove.  Clearly the top was cracked...there were no \"scratches\" prior to removing the pot and scratches do not make a cracking sound.  You could also very easily feel the cracks in the glass.  \nMy Home warranty company dispatched Beyer Appliance Service.  \nThe tech that came to my house merely took pictures of the glass.  He was completely dishonest with me.  He told me that several of the cracks appeared to be surface cracks but agreed that there was one long crack that appeared to go all the way through.  He made just a minimal attempt to examine the glass.  I literally had to assist him with the light on my cell phone so that he could take pictures.  He took pictures of the top and submitted a report to my home warranty company.  A short time later my home warranty called me to deny my claim because the tech reported that they were only scratches.  This was not what the tech reported to me.  I called the office and only after probing, the office employee informed me that the tech reported that they were just surface cracks.  I assured the office that was not what the tech reported to me.  I then informed the office that I would be happy to hold them liable for any damage of injury such as electrocution because their actions led to my home warranty refusing my claim.  The office worker then advised me not to use my stove and also informed me in a threatening manner that she was recording my call.  I am very confused...I thought they were just scratches.  Why wouldn't Beyer stand behind their tech's judgement and be unconcerned about damage or injury stemming from a cracked stove top.  Clearly I must be uninformed.  I thought it was just scratches...  Terrible experience and sadly what you typically get from contractors used by home warranty companies.  \nAs a side note...because I know my home warranty company is terrible, I asked for pricing on the glass replacement plus installation.  The tech told me the part was about $293.  He then explained how to install it because he felt I could easily do it myself.  Basically two nuts and the top will lift right off.  I then asked him to find out how much to install.  The tech quoted me about $593 materials and labor.  So basically an additional $300 for a top that only a minute before the tech was explaining would pop right on with little effort.   He advised me to just buy a new stove at half the price.",

To be fair there was another 4 people in the restaurant though. I'm sure that put a strain on the \"cook\". When it was time to pay for the bill, the Predator reemerged. \n\nThe Ugly: everything was burnt. Even the saganaki \"opah\" cheese was made to sit on the table opposite ours. I had a few minutes to just sit there and watch it burn in flames. At least 3 minutes before it occurred to her to use the lemon wedge to put out the fire. The souvlakia were all burnt to a dry crisp. The rice tasted like it was cooked in dishwater and even the potatoes smelled and tasted like the secret ingredient in the lemon sauce was rat poison. \n\nFolks,  I'm not exaggerating. This is what happens when a restaurant doesn't taste their own food. If they did,  I'm sure they would have truly burned it until it was just charred remains.

I could only hear the people directly beside me and across from me so it wasn't a good birthday dinner atmosphere.  I ordered a couple of appetizers -- the bone marrow and the bacon wrapped dates.  My husband enjoyed the bone marrow and the bacon wrapped dates were pretty tasty but you only got three.  I had the mac & cheese and brussel sprouts as my entr\u00e9e. This is where the problems really began.  I think most of us ordered two things and they came out so sporadically over 15-20 minutes.  My brussel sprouts were almost gone by the time I finally received my mac & cheese.  Nobody felt they could start eating, of course, until everyone had been served...and to make matters worse, the birthday girl was one of the last to be served.  Now here's the kicker...  Our bill came and it was $97.  I reviewed it and didn't notice anything wrong and put my credit card inside.  When I received my card back with receipt I noticed the amount was now $104.  The difference was they added on my second beer which had been left off the first bill.  I completely admit owing for that but if the amount changed and they realized their error they should have come back and communicated that to me before charging.  It just came across as a little shady...  I highly doubt we'll ever return, especially with that kind of price tag on a mediocre meal.",

Asking me to hold my leg up higher, no big deal, but still weird. I asked for a five minute extra massage, which I always do and pay for it, he said they don't do that here and looked at me like I asked for a happy ending, I didn't even know how to respond. I didn't bring my own polish like usual, so I picked a color that I thought match my match my nails. He painted one streak and I noticed that quickly it was way to dark. I asked if could help me pick a matching color he said it was not his job while getting extremely upset. I stopped him and asked if I could have someone else finish the quick, painless paint job. Bottom line is, heat, no heat when I get a pedicure it is to relax, not have someone rush, make me uncomfortable and treat me badly.

Quaint atmosphere and friendly staff. \n\nThat's what I would've written on my last review, but we came back to visit with our toddler and some friends and were very disappointed. \n\nCinnamon rolls came out cold and stale. They heated it up, but, it was to stale for it to matter. Even my 2 year old lost interest. \n\nThe famous apple pancakes used to be served with butter, and special syrup covering the whole thing, almost falling off the plate! I was bummed to see the plate come with pancakes lukewarm with nothing on them. The waitress brought the syrup on the side 5 minutes later. No butter. The syrup was less than 1/2 of the amount it used to be.\n\nTwo of us had ordered bacon and eggs to accompany our meal. They both came out cold. I sent mine back asking for them to be taken off the check thinking I would just pay for the rest of the meal and be on my way. This obviously isn't the place that it used to be and I was fine and ready to pay and leave.\n\nWhat I assume was the manager/owner came to see what the problem was, we told her, and she questioned why we didn't say something sooner and walked off. She took off the cinnamon roll instead, which was a nice enough gesture, but that's not what I asked for. I pointed it out and she rudely told me it would take another 10 minutes to take the item off the bill, and threw $3 cash on the table instead, insisting that she could've made it right. I pointed out that with our toddler, we didn't have enough time for a 2nd round of food to \"make it right\" and she just said, \"we're very busy\" ... \n\nThere was no \"i'm sorry\" or \"give us another try next time, this one's on us\" ... this is what good customer service sounds like.  It was pretty obvious they just wanted us gone, and paying as much of the bill as possible. I paid my bill, left a generous tip for our original waitress, who was very friendly. But I won't be back.

I may not have tried real gamjatang (pork bone soup) from Korea but I'm a gamjatang addict and frequent Korean restaurants with my Korean friends in search of the best tasting soup in Toronto - as well as the one with the most similar taste. My usual spots are Mom's and Lim Ga Ne. My friend and I decided to try Ka Chi out since 1. it's almost always packed, 2. seems trendy, and 3. was on the Top 9 list. \n\nThe restaurant is fairly big compared to the neighbouring Korean restaurants but they crammed SO many tables in. I was basically bumping elbows with the guy at the next table. It was very uncomfortable. I ordered the gamjatang. As usual, we were given appetizers - which were decent. Our gamjatang arrived shortly after. The broth and pork were okay... I've had better. I didn't like the bean sprout pairing... I do think that traditional gamjatang comes with napa cabbage - so I prefer that over the bean sprouts. To sum it up, the food wasn't as it was hyped up to be.\n\nNow the reasons why I give this place 1 star: Not only was the service poor for us - but it wasn't a pleasant experience for everyone else. It was very apparent at how annoyed the other customers were. Sure, food came out quickly but the waiters and bussers were running around like headless chickens. We over heard the table next to us (they were so close to us, we heard their own conversation even though they spoke softly) had errors on their bill, took forever for the error to be corrected. Neighbouring customers were trying to signal waiters and/or bussers but they were so busy (and probably stressed out) that they didn't even notice. Having worked in the restaurant industry for years, I felt bad, so my friend and I informed them. Their system isn't the best. They cram so many tables in and try to turn over tables very quickly to serve as many customers as possible - this isn't good for the waiters and in turn results in poor service. Of course, only management is to blame. \n\nWould I come back here? No.",

I saw that they charged me 16 dollars so I was confused. Then the dude brought out our food with a receipt that was not itemized and had no total on it. My boyfriend had to go inside to grab the itemized receipt which showed that the girl had charged us for an extra drink that we did not ask for. The guy at the counter was really nice and he gave us some desserts to make up for it. (If you're reading this, thank you again) so after that we were fine and went home.

I was excited to try it because being from the south I love to try any southern resto in my area. \n\nWe walk in and see a tiny counter top, we are informed that we can walk outside and into the dining room. So we decide on that. The menu is a simple piece of paper with their limited options. They have smoked brisket, pulled pork, or fried chicken and a plethora of sides.\n\nThis is what we ordered: brisket with hush puppies and Mac n cheese. \n3 piece fried chicken with pinto beans and bacon, mashed potatoes and gravy, and cornbread.\n\nAt first glance I can tell you a few things about the brisket. What I can tell you is that it isn't smoked and it doesn't taste good. Brisket when smoked should have a nice brown color with a dark outer bark. This looks like steamed flesh. Guess what? It's dry and very lack luster. I decide to add some of their homemade sauces to spice it up. Their vinegar based sauce is basically just vinegar and it wasn't good. The ketchup based was just that. Ketchup. \n\nThe Mac and cheese was delicious, warm, and creamy for the first few bites. Once we got deeper into the mac and got to the sauce it got kind of disgusting. Have you ever eaten anything that you hate more and more with each bite? It left a sour after taste in my mouth. I've never had this happen before with food. The hush puppies were unremarkable at best. I didn't like or hate them.\n\nThe fried chicken had a nice spice coat. The skin was very good because that is where all the flavor lived. Once we got past the skin the chicken was dry. Thank God for the gravy because that was amazing! The pinto beans were good, the mashed potatoes were amazing (again, that gravy!), and the corn bread was bad, like really bad. One side was cooked well and the bottom side was practically raw. \n\nWhat impressed me? I loved their sparkling homemade lemonade. I liked how knowledgable their wait staff was on the menu and the sauces. I also really loved their \"Derby Pie\" which is made with chocolate chips, bourbon, and walnuts. It was so sweet I hated myself for eating it. \n\nWhat didn't impress me: in general their food. The fact that after eating I had to walk out of the dining room, outside to the street, and come back in the \"counter top\" part to pay.\n\nI might try again in the summer with their picnic baskets but right now I'm still wondering how they have 119 positive reviews when I was less than not even impressed.",

On one hand, it is located in a prime location- in the middle of Old Montreal and walking distance to the metro and several attractions. On the other hand, everything else..\n\nThe location is the major seller of this hotel, being in the middle of the most popular neighborhoods for tourists. But if you are driving, be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for their valet parking. The fee when we visited in Oct 2017 was $35CAD per night with in/out privileges. However, due to the space issue in the area their lot is not directly on site, so you have to call the front desk 15 minutes in advance to when you actually need you car. We ended up parking at a nearby lot for $18CAD/night.\n\nWe checked in on a Friday and the front desk attendant was friendly enough, she informed us that our room was in a different building and a valet would come to help us with our bags. We weren't sure what this meant so we just went with it. We were sent 2 blocks away into a tiny building with a restaurant and bar directly underneath us. This should have been a red flag, but we were too tired and confused.\n\nWe didn't realize that most of the rooms would not be in the main building. And that there would be no elevator. Our room was small and dated, but had a rustic feel to it with the exposed walls, wooden floors, and oversized windows. The view was obstructed by the building across the street, but we didn't really care too much. The room was clean enough, and came stocked with a full kitchen which was nice.\n\nIt all seemed fine until nighttime came. The beds here are extremely soft, something I am not used to, but I'm sure many others would love. The restaurant and bar downstairs was listed to close at 11, and the from desk even confirmed it. But for some reason, the music(and extremely heavy bass) was still going very loudly until past 1am. Even with our windows and curtains tightly shut, we could hear the restaurant's customer on the street being loud. We couldn't say for sure if they were drunk, but either way they were painfully loud. The bf is not by any means a light sleeper, and even he lost sleep. We ended up not being able to get up as early as we had planned because we were both just too tired. The next night was Saturday and by 9pm the noise got significantly louder. We wanted to go to bed but even if we had purchased earplugs, the thumping of the bass was enough to disturb us. We called the front desk, and they offered to move us. After about 40 minutes, we were moved to another building about 3 blocks away. They tried to explain that noise is a common issue in the neighborhood, but I don't think it is since our new room was nice and quiet for the rest of our stay (and on a Saturday night). Additinally, I don't know if our complaining had anything to do with the fact that when we called in for a razor, they came back 20m later to say that they were out of razors and didn't offer me any alternative solutions (like, where can I go buy one, will they have more the day after, etc.??).\n\nWhile I greatly appreciate their moving us to a different room without much hassle, I also really don't understand how they can operate their business this way. The entire first building we stayed must be a nightmare to stay in at night. Also, when I asked, the front desk assured me that the resraurant/bar closed at 11pm- but they had their music and custormers outside well past 1am! If you're going to try to cover that up, at least try harder. She sounded confused as to why I would complain, and I had to justify it by saying that we slept early since we like getting an early start.\n\nOverall, I really don't think we would stay here again or recommend it to our friends. If you like to party late into the weekends, this probably wouldn't bother you as much. But either way, it would've been really helpful to know beforehand.",

I've never had a cavity or any problems at all really, though they had said I had borderline gingivitis and gave me suggestions for improving my brushing habits. Enter Waterfront Dentistry...I only went because I \"won\" a free teeth whitening at the Phoenix Bridal Show. I hadn't been worried about the color of my teeth, but it's free so why not? The staff at Waterfront were pleasant enough and there was impressive high tech equipment, but the dentist was very alarmed at how much recession I had in my gums. He said I might need grafting surgery, but he recommended a revolutionary cutting edge treatment that only he does (~$700). And he did not recommend whitening because he thought it would be too painful for me. So I didn't get the whitening, instead, all I acquired was insecurity and fear about my teeth which I'd never had before. I visited my regular dentist a month later and he asked me questions like \"is it bothering you?\" and when I said no, he recommended keeping an eye on it if the recession progresses, but it's nothing to worry about. I've since moved to Oregon and met a new dentist who has confirmed the perspective of brushing carefully, but nothing major is needed at this stage.\n\nMy experience with Waterfront was over 2 years ago now. Perhaps there's been a change in management  but as of December 2012, I'm convinced Waterfront made their money preying on the insecurities of brides.

We planned on three sleeping there and a few more came by to get ready with us before heading out to Old Town to party. We all had our share of negative experiences at this resort throughout the night. First we were bombarded by the front desk/people near the elevators as to how many were in our room/what the names were. This isn't really any of their business, we knew how many would be staying the night and we paid accordingly, ($20 extra per person) but to ask names or try to demand to know a head count is ridiculous and invasive. The way they asked was very rude as well. We tried to laugh it off and go on with our good time. \n\nOnce we got to the suite we were in love, it had a beautiful living room area and separate bedroom with an amazing bathroom. They had a \"mini bar\" set up of two martini glasses, a cocktail shaker, and SMALL ice bucket. I'm talking small, like smaller than your average ice cream container. The ice machine was down the hallway and after two trips that made barely three drinks I asked one of the girls to get an extra when she was going to the front desk to meet a few other of our friends. She came back to tell me when she asked the person at the front desk said, \"WHY? WHAT DO YOU NEED IT FOR, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE ONE?!\" and refused to give a second ice bucket. We were starting to get annoyed at this point. Who cares WHY we need a second one, it's obvious we need MORE ICE and don't want to keep going out into the hall, and if you make a note we have a second in our room it's not like we are going to try and steal a stupid ice bucket. They could have politely stated it was policy to have only one per room, or ANY excuse would have worked as long as they had been nice about it, but no, she was met with the same demanding rude accusation type response like we had earlier with the guest count. Again, we tried to laugh it off and continue the celebration.\n\nWe left to go out for the night and had an amazing time at several clubs in Scottsdale, and around 12:30 decided to go back to the resort as we read online that the club 270 stayed open until 2am so we figured we could finish our night there. We walked up to the elevator room with the desk and there were two people standing behind it a man and a woman, and before we could even fully walk up to the desk they started to literally shout at us, \"NO MORE WRISTBANDS, NOPE, WE AREN'T GIVING OUT ANYMORE WRISTBANDS\" and I said I don't know what wristbands mean and she said we are closed we aren't letting anyone else in tonight, and I said the website said it stays open until 2 and it's only 1:15, and she just kept shaking her head trying to get us out as fast as possible like no apology whatsoever no explaining NOTHING, just complete utter disrespect. Us girls were not acting out in any way, we didn't run in screaming and yelling like drunken fools that needed to be shut down, we were calm and pleasant and this girl treated us like some 22 year old college frat boys who were throwing up all over the place black out drunk. I shrugged my shoulders and said whatever and we walked out and headed back to our suite. The bride to be at this point was VERY offended and she was in shock at how we were treated. She didn't feel like stopping the evening short, so her myself and another one of our friends decided to head back out to the Casino floor and have a good time anyways. On the way there I told them I was going back to that club desk, I walked up and said politely \"Hi what's your name?\" smiling the whole time, and she looked at me and didn't say a word, it was obvious she wanted to cover up her name tag, but I looked and saw and said, \"Kaylin? Okay thank you!\" and kept smiling as I turned on my heel and left knowing full well I would be calling the next day to make a formal complaint about the entire night of rude employees and most specifically this Kaylin girl.\n\nOur group of three continued our fun & won some money at the slots which ended our night on a high note.\n\nThe next morning after checking out and getting home I called the resort and was connected easily to a front desk supervisor and she listened to my laundry list of complaints about their employees HUGE PROBLEM with attitude. We paid almost $500 for the suite alone for one night and we should have been treated like movie stars, not bums. The supervisor was kind enough to offer a generous % off the total bill, and also said another manager would be calling to check up and hear more specifically about this Kaylin girl. He called within a few hours and said he would watch the security tapes and deal with the matter personally. So that is what gets Talking Stick it's one star, I was happy to have our issues heard and get appropriate responses.\n\nThe entire resort is nice, but if they continue to have rude employees I have a feeling they will need to change a lot to keep customers happy.",

Unfortunately, my experience did not meet my expectations. \n\nUpon entering, we were not greeted by a person, but a sign indicating we were to wait to be seated.  So, we waited and waited and waited.  At least 3 servers walked past us without so much as a \"someone will be right with you\". Only when we started to leave did a host come over to show us to a table.\n\nOur waiter was pleasant, but never told us his name, did not ask if we had been there before and seemed pretty rushed to get our drink order.  I must say, the drinks came out quickly as did our appetizer...almost too quickly.  There was no way the chicken lettuce wraps could have been prepared that fast.  Chicken was dry, and there was more dried fruit than my Aunt Carole's fruitcake.\n\nOur drinks were empty, but we were not asked if we would like another until the main courses came out.  There was enough time before our food came for at least another drink, and generally our bar tab is double our food, so FEZ missed out on the extra alcohol sales.\n\nNow for the food, and the main reason we went was for the sweet potato fries....YUCK!!!  They were terrible.  Way too much cinnamon, way, way too much!  The burger was good however, and my salad was ok, but too much dressing and the chicken was dry.\n\nSo, there we sat with empty glasses, food pushed to the side, obviously waiting for service and the check, but what happened to our waiter who was so quick to get our order originally?  Sitting at a table, gossiping with his friends/patrons as we sat there and sat there and sat there...finally we asked a passing waitress for our tab.  Mr. Chatty still never came over until after we had paid the bill and were getting up to leave.\n\nDoubtful we will go back, but the 2 stars are mainly for the fact that this was our first experience and I have to believe that all the other reviewers can't be so wrong...could have been an off night, but I guess I just have higher expectations.",

This is a very average restaurant and none of their food has any correlation to how the actual dish tastes.\n\npositives\n  - Ambience is decent.\n  - Taste of food isn't awful unlike the other Indian restaurants in Champaign.\n  - Their yellow dal is probably the only food which is good. Sometimes their samosas are ok.\n\nnegatives\n  - The food prepared though named after indian dishes, do not taste anything like that. Especially the Biryani is laughable since its just some masala rice. It tastes ok but please don't call it Biryani. The same goes for most of their dishes. This is the only place that gives Biryani without Raita. Also their rice that comes with other accompaniments is so poor in quality.\n - Too much artificial color in the food.\n - The various entrees with Paneer are just messed up.\n - The chicken and lamb mostly taste stale and only fish hasn't been that bad. \n \nIf you want to eat something which tastes like Indian food go to bloomington and there are some good restaurants there, hope they would start one here.",

I'm still a New Kids fan and I loved Mark Mark when he front lines the Funky Bunch. I'm also a Boston Red Sox fan so I had to check this out. I went with my mom before the Jays/Red Sox game on 30/08/17 because we both were curious. And I'm glad we went. The staff were friendly and we were seated promptly as well as order drinks quickly. When we asked for recommendations, our waiter was more then happy to help. I chose to have their special The Smokin Burger with Sweet Potato Tots for a side. My ordered The Melt. We just went with gingerale and coke for drinks. Nothing  fancy there. Maybe because I had no expectations I thought the food was so good. I could just barely finish my burger. It was juicy and topped with yummy condiments - the hot sauce was spicy but not so much that it was unbearable; the caramelized onions added a sweetness to the burger, and the peameal was added a smoky flavour that I didn't find annoying (normally I dislike peameam bacon...yeah, I know). And the tots? Holy crap they were delicioius. Honestly, I could've just had those. Unfortunately, I can't speak for The Melt although it looked just as yummy. I took away a star because we had to wait when it got busy. Which I feel like they should be used to because it was game day and that whole area gets busy. Other than that, it was great.

Today they were trying hard to sell my friend, Dan, and me their pimento cheese appetizer. The problem (for me) is that it included bacon. I am not a pork or beef eater, so NO to bacon!  I had a chicken sandwich that came with fries.  Oh yes, the sandwich came with bacon, which I asked them to hold. It also had a lot of garlic, which made it not quite as good for me.   I loved the tables and the space. I observed that they can accommodate larger groups of people, which is a good thing.  The music and acoustics were not conducive to good conversation, until after the lunch hour settled down.   I liked discovering this spot and so glad that we went. Next time, I will see if they can do some bacon-free pimento cheese. And I will go well after the lunch crowd has come and gone.",

If you do, you will most likely never have an interest in seeing another Cirque performance and that would be a travesty.\n\nSecondly, unless you like throwing $200 in the toilet, stay far from this miserable show.    i was so incredibly bored.   I had more fun watching all the people in the audience and trying to read what the girl was texting on her phone in front of me.  ( I know that was wrong )\n\nThird,  if I had been blindfolded and taken there without knowing where I was and then all of a sudden they took it off, I would think I was at a high school or junior college performance at best.\n\nHowever, there was one scene that was AMAZING so I must give credit for that part of the show.   There is a superhero trampoline performance that was incredible.   That was the only scene that woke me up and had my attention.   After that, it was back to the high school musical bore fest.\n\nI wish I could get my money back and two hours of my life.\n\nIf you plan on seeing a show, consider Ka o \"O\".    Those are both great and worth the $$$$ and time.\n\nGood luck in the casinos!!",

        "text": "Agh. Gack. Blaaaarrrrrgggggg! WTF happened to Penn & Teller!?\n\nFor the first time ever watching these guys - either live or on TV - I actually felt like I was bored. I've seen their act live before in San Francisco a few years back and LOVED it. They were alive, fun, and the crowd was totally into it. But oh man, how far things have fallen.\n\nFirst of all, I love these guys. They CAN be funny and entertaining. Maybe they were having an off night, because it felt like they could have cared less about the act and were just going through the motions... for the 10,000th time that year. It just all felt so dry, and they seemed bored of it. And if they felt bored, I definitely felt bored. Parts of the act hadn't changed in years, but there was definitely some cool stuff in there (like when they pull the guy up on stage and move stuff around on the table in front of him... that WAS funny.)\n\nPersonally, I think Vegas is where comedians go to get a permanent show and get unfunny. In the same way that Cirque du Soliel goes to Vegas to get their own theater and get boring. When they're doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over night after night, I can't help but feel like the passion for what they do has been drummed out of them by endless repetition. Personally, I think the guys would be better off dumping the permanent show and get back out on the road. The rock stars of magic lost their mojo, and they need to get it back, otherwise they might as well be doing bad card tricks at a Holiday Inn lounge off a state highway.\n\nAs always, they were gracious enough to do photos with the audience after the show and sign autographs, but that too felt like they just weren't into it at all. Penn just kept saying \"thanks Boss\" to everybody - male or female - like he was manning a rivet machine on an assembly line.\n\nSigh. Guys, you were SO freakin' hilarious when you were on the road. But you lost your jazz. Ya' gotsta' get in back, baby. Don't go out boring. And the gun trick? It's been cool, but it needs something new.\n\nI miss the fun Penn & Teller.

Where are my chips and salsa? Oh, we have to order them? Hmmm... I was slightly suspicious. I politely declined the popcorn and perused the drink list. The list looked good! My husband and I both wanted to try something different - I got the blueberry mojito and he ordered a fresh mango margarita with salt. Forever and ever later, our drinks arrived. Mine was fine. Just fine. His drink tasted like they had mashed up some frozen mango and it had thawed in his drink. It also did not come rimmed with anything. Small detail, but still... \n\nWe ordered the guacamole trio as an appetizer. Whoa. A ton of guacamole. We probably should have asked another couple to sit with us and help us eat it. The guacamole concept, three different guacs, all a little bit different, is a great idea. Unfortunately, it tasted like pre-made guacamole that each had a little bit of something mixed in at the last minute. Totally disappointed. The chips were ok but also nothing amazing. \n\nOur meals were fine. Nothing exciting. My husband ordered three different tacos - he said the pork one was excellent, the other two were pretty blah. I also ordered a fish taco and it was ok. Nothing stellar. \n\nAll in all, our entire experience took less than an hour. Our server was super nice, the bar was neat and clean and cool.

        "text": "It is with great regret that I write this review, not because I had a bad experience, but because when you can't usually afford a place like this, it almost seems like a sacriledge to say something negative about a restaurant with 2 Michelin starts. Nevertheless, I always keep it real for yelp and so will be as honest and thorough as I can.\n\nNot gonna lie, I had a little wonder dust in my eye when I walked in and saw the place, got seated by my server and had a napkin placed on my lap (\"seriously, I can do it myself... oooh well, ok.. thanks\"). The menu looked amazing and so we procedded to order a round of cocktails (a tart martini for me (pomegranate liquor with ginger ale) and appetizers.\n\nThe tart martini was fine, not amazing but drinkable. The heirloom tomato salad was very very nice- containing a range of different heirloom tomatoes, beets and melons. Very lightly seasoned, but delicious enough that my non-watermelon-eating boyfriend actually enjoyed it. Success.\n\nThen on to the main course. I ordered the lamb dish and my other counterparts ordered the steak, the sea bass and the lobster (among other dishes that I did not try and hence will not review). The server told us that main dishes take about 30mins to make because they are made from scratch. I was perfectly fine with this as it promised to be a great meal.\n\nMy lamb dish was good- alright here it goes: The lamb was cooked well, and it camed with thinly slices potatoes layered with thin pieces of lamb. Separately there were large chunks of lamb that were rubbed in an olive tapenade and cooked that way. To be honest, I have had more flavorful lamb at a lower (almost diner style) restaurants. The lamb was tender but it had no flavor - it didnt seem like it had been marinating in any sauce, and that the cooking time was fast (some of the best lamb dishes get cooked for 8hrs+). The potatoes did not have a lot of seasoning to it and it seemed overall bland. \n\nMy bf's steak was great, juicy and cooked perfectly. The brocolli souffle that came with it, however, was pretty bland and nothing special (hate to say that I have made better broccoli souffles at home). His mom did not like the sea bass at all- thought it had no flavor (it even came with bacon mashed potatoes) and that it wasn't even coocked properly.\n\nFinally, we ordered a chocolate and lime soufflee for dessert. The chocolate one was ok- a little undercooked and lacking fluff. The second one was definitely flulfier, but I could tell the undercooked factor because it tasted predominately like raw egg-whites- not a good sign.\n\nThe service seemed to be impecable except for one giant giant mistake: According to standard table service, servers should wait until all members of the table are done eating before they can remove all plates. However, the servers here did not wait and removed all plates but 1, leaving my bf as the only one still eating at the table. This is very rude because when you remove other people's empty dishes, you make the (still eating) person pressured and rushed to finish, which is not the dining experience you should be creating.\n\nSo there you go folks: my (hopefully) super objective opinion about a fancy 2 michelin star restaurant. Feel free to agree or disagree. I am sure everyone has a different dining experience.",

We sat at a table without white table cloth but that shouldn't mean terrible service right? \n\nFirstly, our server didn't look too happy and was totally out of it. We asked for a drink menu so he got it for us alright. He plopped a THICK drink menu and just left. No recommendations, no nothing. When we finally got his attention and asked for recommendations, his response was \"There's a table of contents here.\" When we gave up, we ordered a bottle of house red cabernet sauvignon (which was still 60usd, so not cheap). As for the meal, we made it easy for the server, we each got the valentine menu (90USD, so not cheap again) even though the restaurant still offered their regular menu (which probably cost less too).\n\nWhen the first plate arrived, presentation looked nice. So I was excited because at this point we were so hungry. However, I got excited too early. The food was cold as if it was sitting in the kitchen for awhile. First course, we ordered was the bone marrow. It  was tasteless; not seasoned well. Second course, the best course of all, was the lobster ravioli. This dish was salty but it had fresh chunks of lobster and at least it wasn't soggy. Third course was the medium rare steak. I'm a huge fan of steaks but this steak was so tough and chewy that I lost interest in it. Lastly, is the dessert. It is a trio but only one out of the three was yummy. \n\nBecause the server was so out of it and our friends were in a rush to a show, we didn't say or complain about it. Since it was on Valentine's day, it was even more disappointing. I'm just glad the busser for our table that day was friendly. I do not understand how this restaurant has such a high rating. I recommend you to add a few bucks and eat at a celebrity chef or Michelin star/ Forbes rating restaurant. Sadly, in my opinion, this place is not worth wasting your calories on. There are definitely many better Italian restaurants out there... Just saying.",

You may pay first and if you decide to add on more time during you massage you can tell the masseuse and pay later. Tips are also collected after service. Maybe this foot spa has had previous customers run away after services and hence the pay before service policy? \n\nThe masseuse I received was from a sweet lady who was very gentle, too gentle almost. Maybe she just wasn't strong enough? She took trips out of the room often to get hot towels, hot stones, and to throw out the dirty water for your feet. If you add up all the time you actually received for your one hour long massage you probably will only have gotten 50 minutes total. \n\nAgain, if you prefer little to no pressure at all this place is for you! $20/hour for a full body massage is a pretty good deal.

Sweet! I figured I would call them to make sure they are in stock before heading over so I gave them a ring. My call immediately went to \"hold\" and for the next 10 minutes alternated between ringing and \"hold\" music. It seemed like there is a limit to how much time someone can be on hold for before it starts ringing at them again which would mean that every time it rings someone was just putting it on hold.\n\nFinally I cursed them (only in my mind since they wouldn't answer the phone) and I phoned back but to customer service. My call was answered quickly. I told them I was trying to reach babies r us and I was on hold for 10 minutes. The customer service rep said \"yea, they are busy over there. What do you want?\"  friendly eh? I told her I was trying to find out if they had a particular baby gate in stock and told her which one. I was put on hold again. A few minutes later, someone answers from babies r us and I explain again what I am looking for. I was put on hold again. A few more minutes later she comes back on and asks more about the gate I am looking for. I told her again and said it's the one on sale. She said they have them in, they don't show that they are on sale but if they show on sale online I can get it for that price. \n\nWhen I got there, I found the gates easily enough. I picked a couple of them up and told the cashier that I was told over the phone that I could get the price that shows online.  She responded \"who told you that?\" so I told her I don't know and that I spoke to someone within the hour who told me that. The cashier picked up the phone and told whoever that she has a customer who says she was told she could get the online price and doesn't know who told her... Ya, sorry... Even if I got a name from mystery phone person I wouldn't remember it! Anyways, seemed like she was told that's cool so she went to check the online price and it turned out to be the same price it scanned in at. Someone just doesn't update signage at this place and this wasn't the first time I have encountered problems with pricing inconsistencies at this place.\n\nThe only reason this place gets two stars instead of one is because, in this case, I did end up getting what I want at the right price and the baby gates are awesome (First Years, extra tall home decor - in case you are wondering).  Also, they were quite easy to find as the layout of the store is very orderly.",

        "text": "Way over priced for the type of service.  $42(after 10% AAA discount) for a simple oil change!  \n\nI'm in the process of trying to find a local mechanic to service my two Hondas( a compact sedan and minivan) so that I don't have to go to the Honda Dealers so that I could possibly save some money.  I decided to try this place out based on the reviews and noticed that they are AAA approved.  I took one of my cars(sedan) in for a simple oil change and and thought I would get a great deal along with the AAA discount.  Not only that, I really wanted this to the be the go to place for my car maintenance.  Upon getting my bill $42, I was disappointed.  Let me explain why I was disappointed.  For $42 bucks I expect a lot more than just an oil/filter change.  When I got the bill, I expected an itemized list of things that were inspected on the vehicle... Like a 20 point inspection with check boxes that explain their findings and need for service like they do at the Honda Dealers...  Sunset Auto didn't even include my tire tread measurements nor the how much brake pads I had left or a graph on how well my battery performed but the Honda Dealers do.   To be honest, they did leave me with a general list of things that might have been inspected, but it is hard to know whether or not they even did anything without details about what the findings were.  On top of that, the service manager/sales manager at the front desk didn't even go over the whole service with me.  There is simply no evidence that they did anything other than change the oil and filter.  By the way, upon inspection of the bill, they put the wrong viscosity oil in my car... They put in 10w20 when the oil cap is clearly marked in bold 5w20.  Lastly my car was not run through a carwash and they left the paper floor mat on the floor for me to throw away myself.  Whew that was a lot!\n\nThe Honda Dealers, on the other hand and to my surprise, were very different and more satisfying.  First of all, I'm always greeted by a friendly service manager who gives me a coupon for a free coffee or bagel at the cafe.  For $35.35(no discount) my minivan got  an oil/filter change plus: the use of Genuine Honda Parts, a full 20 something point inspection with a detailed itemized list of what they did including their findings (i e tire pressure, tread wear, break pad wear, battery performance, fluids and which fluids were topped off, etc...), a list of open recalls, a carwash dried by hand, and no mess inside the car.  On top of that, the service manager explained each and every item on the list including what the recalls where about and the urgency level.  Did I mention that they replace the oil in my car with the correct oil viscosity and they always replace the washer for the drain valve as recommended per Honda.\n\nUpon comparison, these two experiences are very different.  If Sunset Auto is willing to give service like the one I experienced with them even once, then isn't it fair for me to be apprehensive and reluctant to going back?   It's really a tough thing to put the vehicle, that you rely on so much, in the hands of people you can't trust to keep it running properly.  For now I'll stick with the Honda Dealers.\n\nI wish you all better experiences while shopping for a mechanic.",

I was not particular impressed with the selection or choice of products (very mainstream withing the alt sport community) but it's a sizable store with lots of copies of the same thing over and over.  So if they carry the type of thing you're looking for they are likely to have it in stock.  The prices are MUCH higher than I expected (also consider that I'm from the US and so it's about double the price).  \n\nYou can buy a prebuilt basic skateboard for $100.  You can get a decent skateboard built from a blank deck, brand-name trucks, ABEC 7 bearings, etc. for $150.

There not prepared for people like us coming from the club even though there open for 24 hours. Yes we're loud and Proud and gay at this time of night but don't give bad service. Slow service with one server and slow pace on getting the food done. Wtf is going on..... Oh wait now the food is here after how long? 1 hour!!!! Thanks idiots!!!

I asked the staff for a healthier option, and they pointed me toward the Fish Machaca, which is seasoned steamed fish on a bed of greens.\n\nI took their suggestion, and it was lackluster to say the least. First of all, it wasn't well seasoned, and there was so very little of the actual fish that I felt totally swindled. \n\nI should have gone with my first thought and gotten the fried fish over a bed of greens, because that tablespoon of steamed fish tasted like nothing...I had to add a bunch of toppings from the salsa bar to get any real flavor. \n\nYou live and you learn, next time I'll stick to what I know and my review will probably be nicer, cuz normally the food here is yummy!",

I came here shortly after opening so I was expecting a super clean restaurant, but many of the empty tables were dirty with crumbs and food still on them. The drink station was far from clean and organized. The bottled drinks at the register were half emptied, the floor felt sticky under my table, and the guy at the register didn't look all that clean himself. He looked rather frumpy.\n\nOrdering was easy and quick. I ordered the Avocado Bacon Club and was asked if I wanted it beef, chicken, turkey or black bean. I decided on the chicken and to have it grilled instead of crispy. I got this with everything on it. I also ordered a side order of fried pickles. My guest got the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger with the Smashfries. Our food probably only took about 7-10 minutes before it was out to us. Everything looked great, but that is as far as the \"great\" went. My biggest disappointment was the fried pickles. They were beyond too salty and they were sitting in a pile of oil..gross!! The sandwich was decent as the bread was good, lettuce was crispy, but the avocado was turning dark and the chicken piece I got in my sandwich was super thin, about the thickness of a deli lunch meat slice. Very disappointing, especially since the sandwich was small, to begin with. \n\nMy guest's sandwich was good, nothing special about it. Said it tasted like the same kind of quality you could have gotten at McDonald's or Burger King and for half the price. Again, the side was very disappointing. The Smashfries were nice and crispy, but they lacked flavor. They had hardly any rosemary on them and I definitely couldn't taste any garlic on them. As you got to the bottom of the pile of fries, they also were sitting in a pile of oil. So sad as I have memories of other Smashburger locations being on point with their food. I probably will not come back to this location again. \n\nWhen we were finished eating, I wanted to clean up after us and throw our trash away, but I guess they have someone come around and get the dirty trays after people leave as there were no trash cans out for the customers. Kind of frustrating for me as I like to clean up when I'm done eating. \n\nThe one guy that was working the front was very friendly. When you ordered your food, he made sure to repeat your order just to make sure he got it correct. When he brought out your food he made sure to ask if you needed anything else. He went around and picked up dirty trays, but I didn't see him wiping down any tables.",

I was soooo looking forward to trying it out and having a wonderful experience but I ended up short. Our waiter was very attentive in the beginning but then he got distracted by a party of girls who either had too much to drink or were just normally extremely outgoing and forward with their conversation. In any case, they were chatting and chatting and chatting and stiiill chatting by the time we had finally set our menus down because we were tired of waiting to order. Their chat probably went on for a good 10-15 minutes in front of our table without our orders having been taken. I didn't worry about it too much but by the end, I was getting frustrated. I know our waiter was probably giving us time to review the menu, but it still seemed a little excessive. Once we ordered, our food did not take too long to arrive but it was definitely mediocre and did not give off a fresh taste. I asked for my food to be prepared spicy and that request was accommodated. We had a restaurant.com coupon and I gave it to our waiter prior to his preparation of our bill. I did not realize a certain percentage of tip was automatically included in the bill until I went to add the tip myself. It appears they automatically added 18%. Now, this is annoying to me. I know some people may not tip properly but I am a regular 20%+ tipper and while our service was not exactly stellar, I probably still would have left a very generous amount (on the full bill, not just the discounted price). Needless to say, I did not add any additional tip to our bill. Don't think I'll ever be going back to this place- not necessarily because the food or atmosphere is bad, but just because the food is not worth the money (you can get similar tasting food at a cheaper Indian buffet place) and the service wasn't the best. As I said, I am feeling very heavy with disappointment just writing this review and it's not even my business! I had high expectations and was super excited to finally try this place but it wasn't all I thought it would be.",

We rate the food a solid 2 out of 10 and service a fat zero.\n\nWe called in and ordered the pork egg foo young combo, chicken chow mein combo and an order of sweet and sour chicken.  I specifically did NOT want chicken lo mein and the non-English speaking person on the phone was queried several times to ensure order was chicken CHOW mein.  After ordering process made lengthy and diffic.ult due to lack of English proficiency, we were told meals would be delivered within an hour.  After more than 90 minutes passed we repeatedly called for five minutes with two phones until someone answered.  We were given excuse that it was Friday and assured food should arrive soon, which it did.\n\nUnfortunately the meals were not as ordered.  The gravy for the egg foo young was forgotten, and we were delivered - SURPRISE - chicken lo mein.  In addition to messing up two of three meals ordered, the quality and taste were extremely lacking.  This is bottom of the barrel Chinese folks - yucko.  The no gravy egg foo young tasted best, while the fried rice was bland and just 95% rice colored with soy.  The sweet and sour chicken was soggy, not crisp - and the sauce of the fake variety bought in large cans at grocery co-ops.  I managed to choke down half the chicken lo mein, which consisted of noodles and upon close examination a few small bits of what may have been chicken and vegetables.  More of our dinner went in the trash than in the mouth.\n\nUpon discovery of the errors, we had again called back.  Management shrugged their shoulders over the mistakes and told us they would offer some kind of discount the next time we ordered.  We gladly informed Hot Wok that due to mistakes in 2 of 3 meals and very poor quality of food we had no desire to ever try their \"food\" again.\n\nStay away everyone - this is seriously lowball bottom of the barrel \"Chinese\" (a stretch of the word).  Much better abounds all around - visit Hot Wok and you'll be sorry!!",

I'll cut to the chase - the experience was awesome. Actually best car buying experience I have ever had. Nick was knowledgeable, took time to understand what I was looking for and delivered. Our entire transaction in and out was just a couple of hours if that.

ABSOLUTELY USELESS. \n\nOk, I don't write a lot of strongly worded reviews, but holy shit, the two girls that work here are the most inefficient, infuriating, millenial stereotypes I have ever met. \n\nI know that you have to wait a long time after a movie at this particular Chatime (I waited 45 mins. At some point, I should've just counted it as a sunk cost and moved on to save myself this headache I have right now). I know that sometimes, technology is a bitch and the card machine will break. No, that's all not included in this low rating. \n\nWhat I do include are the 2 (of 3) employees that are doing shit jobs. Is inefficiency and rudeness part of the Chatime training manual or was that just a bonus for all the customers? \n\nFirst of all, the machine is broken. Fine. But it's not like you guys can fix it anyway, you bimbos. Stop pretending. And also, if you're going to pretend, at least put on a serious face instead of giggling around. From the time I was close to the counter to the time I was actually at it was an absolute test of my patience and sanity. \n\n1) One customer in front of me had no cash. That's ok, shit happens. Ladies at the counter, serve someone else instead of SITTING THERE GIGGLING, waiting for the customer's backup cash to arrive. There's an HOUR LONG LINE WAITING. \n\n2) Another customer in front of me had cash in hand to avoid such nonsense. The girls at the counter were STILL fiddling with the stupid broken machine. Just get the order in!! \n\n3) Finally, it's my turn. They didn't even LOOK at me for 2 minutes. I finally speak up and ask \"is the machine broken?\" They say yes, and go back to ignoring me for the machine and each other. Finally, after another 3 minutes, the black haired one looks up and says \"Ya, so what's your order?\" Leave your rudeness at the door, little girl. No wonder your tip cup is empty. \n\n4) My bubble tea is FINALLY made. It's just sitting in the machine that puts the plastic cover on. 5 mins later, the cashier girls are still fooling around. They literally just had to turn around. It got to the point where the one employee that was actually making the bubble tea (the only person actually DOING THEIR JOB) saw that we were getting impatient and tried to get her coworkers' attention. After that failed because they were giggling too hard or some shit, she got it for us herself. \n\nI don't have anything against young people in service. I'm relatively young myself and I've worked in the service industry. But THIS is why other generations think millenials are lazy and incompetent!! Chatime, your drinks are fucking delicious but train your staff properly. The service at this branch is a joke, and not in a \"what a funny story I can tell my friends later\" kind of way. More of a \"rant to my friends what an awful place this is\" kind of way. \n\n(33/100) - 2016",

I previously would pick up salads at the Rabba on Simcoe, but they started being mostly just spinach and almost no toppings, so I was excited when something new opened up equally close by.\n\nMy first issue that I have is the cleanliness of the \"salad bar\".  The tongs are always scattered all over the place, so handles are actually ending up in the food containers, which means everyone's germy, winterty hands are going all over the food.  There are no food labels and cross contamination is all over the place, so if you have an allergy, stay away.  They used to have a lot more selection and now it's just the same toppings again and again.  Sometimes, especially by Friday, they don't look so fresh or new anymore.  \n\nThe prepackaged beet/goat cheese salad is pretty good, and so is the weird \"chia yogurt\" concoction they have.\n\nI've only ever had soup one time (usually the flavours don't appeal to me at ), it was a tomato soup, the small size looks REALLY SMALL but it was a good amount, very very salty, and came with a slice of olive bread (wasn't given a choice of bread).\n\nThe line is confusing (you are supposed to line up to order sandwiches but if you have something just to pay for, like pre-packaged or salad bar, you can skip the line - there should be signage for this).  The girl who does the checkout is friendly and often helps me close my salad container (SO HARD TO CLOSE!), but the dude who owns the restaurant/the manager is not friendly - to me.  He's very friendly to everyone else.  He literally has never said \"hi\" to me or smiled at me or acknowledged me, often looking right past me and saying hi to someone else in line, even though I'm there every day.  This has irked me since the beginning.  I tried some varied approaches - smiling at him first, looking him in the eyes, etc - but nada.  I am not sure what that's about although I have theories.\n\nToday he gave the woman ahead of me who was buying LESS than me a plastic bag with handles, and when I asked for a bag, they gave me a paper bag (it was pouring rain out).\n\nSo....that's not great.",

The same can NOT be said for Borgata in Scottsdale.  \n\nThe receptionists unfortunately ruined the experience so I feel like I cannot review the actual professionals there.  I went in to take advantage of a spray tan package I purchased as I've been going to Dolce- Chandler for 5 years.  They claimed I had 3 fewer tans than I had purchased and I simply complained that every time I go- the receptionists seem confused by my tan package and that perhaps one or two were mistakenly taken from me.  This young lady threw a hissy fit, stormed away from me, practically did everything, but pout.  Naturally, I asked to speak to a manager.  I was kind of stunned to what had just happened!  The manager was calm, but it wasn't until I told her I would write about my experience on Yelp that I got any kind of apology.  Never underestimate the power of YELP!  She was kind and gave me an extra tan for my terrible experience which was good because I will continue to come here for other services, just NOT in Scottsdale.  \n\nThis experience has motivated me to write a separate review about the lady who does my eyebrows at their Chandler location.

        "text": "Boy, looks sure can be deceiving...\n\nWalking into Jackie Bee, you might think you're in a new modern style cafe, rather than a boba shop. Located in the Charleston Festival plaza, this new spot is open, appears clean and is decked out with decent looking furniture and several flat screen TV's. 6 of those TV's are home to the menu which features several boba drinks and a decent amount of food options, including bento boxes.\n\nAfter standing around and checking out the menu for a few minutes, the girl behind the counter asked if we had been there before. We had not, so she said they had some suggestions of popular items...which ended up just being two things, the Chrysanthemum Milk Tea and the Ice-Cream Ball Coffee Jelly Milk Tea. Both seemed pretty straight forward, but she didn't bother to explain anything in anyway or offer any other help. I was also disappointed that she just offered the people in front of us a 10% discount for them just opening, but didn't mention the same deal to us. She was nice enough, but the counter service is basically nonexistent for the most part. \n\nI ended up ordering an Oolong Milk Tea with boba and a KungPao Chicken bento box. The bento box is priced just under $9 and includes meat, a side of greens and fried rice. Going off the flavors and textures alone, nothing appeared to be freshly made. The fried rice had virtually no flavor on its own and seemed more like something you'd get out of the freezer. Unfortunately, the chicken was just as bad and had this awful flavor that tasted like burnt soy sauce. Overall it was just a really bad plate of food and I ended up not finishing it. Thankfully my drink was much better and even half price since I ordered a combo meal. The milk tea was flavorful, not overly sweet, and the boba was very decent. A little chewy, but not soggy or slimy.\n\nMy biggest issue with the drinks here is their regular teas. Our 6 year old son has quite possibly the simplest drink order you could make. He gets a plain ole' black iced tea with boba. No sweetener, no flavors, nothing...just tea and boba. When I asked the girl if they offered a tea like that, she said yes and punched his order in. Yet when we got his drink, it had this extremely strong orange flavor and was really sweet. When I took it back and asked if this was right, she said it was and that this was there house tea, but because I ordered unsweetened that's how it tastes. I was confused as she just told me the tea was plain and unsweetened only 5 minutes before that. She offered a generic apology and basically sent me on my way. I didn't bother wasting anymore money on ordering another drink.\n\nAnother strange thing about this place is their neighboring business, the PVP Zone. I'm not sure if the two are co-owned or if they are just partnering up to generate business for each other, but there is a door inside that goes between the two and people were shuffling in and out constantly. The worst part was this particular guy that I had not seen the whole time during my visit until close to the end. He came in from next door and walked back behind the counter to talk to one of the Jackie Bee employees. While that employee was making a drink in a blender, this guy was standing right next to him constantly running his fingers through his hair. I was too far away to see if anything might be coming off the dudes head, but had I seen that when I walked in, I woulda walked right back out. They let at least 2 other people from next door walk behind the counter and just hang out besides him too. With customers drinks being made in that same area, I think the owners or managers should be paying a lot more attention to who's \"hanging out\" here.\n\nEven with the several boba spots in town, I've been waiting to check out Jackie Bee since I seen the sign a few months ago. Sadly, this was a super disappointing visit and even though the boba was decent enough, I'm not sure I'd come back anytime soon. There's way too many better choices for boba alone, and the food didn't add anything worthwhile. 1.5 stars.",

They also have a few video game machines. Don't expect anything fancy.\n\nThere are two rooms here: the Mainstage and the Cabaret. I have seen shows in both rooms.\n\nThe Mainstage room can fit over 100 people but it's pretty small and cramped. Most chairs are the foldable type and they are very close together. There is little leg room and little elbow room. I saw a show here on a Monday night and it wasn't too busy, maybe a quarter full, so I got to spread my legs. Had it been packed, I would've been very uncomfortable. The floor isn't graded so if you get stuck behind a big person you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nThe Cabaret room is smaller than the Mainstage room. It holds about 30-40 people. Seating is a mix of lone chairs, chairs with tables, and couches. It is less cramped than the Mainstage room. I went here on a Saturday night and it was almost full. Some things I didn't like included the fact that the doors to this room were glass, so if you're sitting near them or facing them, it can be tempting to look out into the lobby/bar area. Also, the room wasn't sound-proofed all that well so the noise from the lobby/bar area was somewhat distracting. I don't know how well the Mainstage room is sound-proofed since I didn't go there on a busy night. The floor isn't graded in the Cabaret room either but that isn't as much of a problem since the seating is more mixed and the sightlines are better.\n\nTheir website has pictures of both rooms so you can see for yourself.\n\nThere is no waiter service during the shows in either room. If you want something to eat or drink, you either have to order it before the show and bring it in with you or you have to get up during the show and leave the showroom to get it yourself. This is the only comedy club I've been to in Toronto without waiter service. In both rooms, most of the seats do not have an accompanying table so you'd have to hold your food/drink in your hand or in your lap or put it on the seat next to you if there's no one there. \n\nThe comedy itself (in both rooms) was below-average but a few acts were good. I know comedy shows can be hit or miss but even on a good night, I would still have serious issues with the layout of the rooms which would prevent me from fully enjoying myself.\n\nThe staff were friendly and the pre-show atmosphere around the bar was okay. The shows I saw were Jokebox Live and Momics. Both ran for about 1.5 hours. Sometimes the shows sell out early depending on the day of week and what show it is.\n\nI was not happy with this place.",

If you were to ask someone who is South Asian or Middle-Eastern their opinion, they might direct you elsewhere (e.g. Paramount), but I have no real qualms with Me Va Me. It's expensive ($21.95 for a salmon skewer box makes is not easy on a lunch budget) but the quality is great if you pick the right items. I've dabbled in many of its choices - the Moroccan cigars (which are so named for their shape - not a cigarette but more of a fried roll), the falafel, and two variations of the chicken skewers box (grilled vegetables or rice) and most recently, the chicken shawarma. The first two items were not as memorable but I have to say the chicken is great - tender, moist and brilliant when paired with the rice (if you are willing to spoil yourself with white rice!). The grilled vegetables aren't a bad alternative when in pursuit of a healthier option. My friend thought it was dry but I thought it was quite nice. I've ordered it several times and will likely continue if I have the chance! The shawarma was okay - not the best I've had (pro tip: if you're ever in Europe, find a hole-in-the-wall shawarma place and prepare to be kind-blown for \u20ac5), but not poor either. What Me Va Me does better than anyone else in my opinion is hummus. This is easily the best hummus I've ever had and I have recommended it to friends aplenty, none of which have returned displeased. It's so creamy and flavourful. The tahini sauce is also resplendent (and similar in flavour profile to the hummus). If anything, I will try to come back again and again for these two - they're simply fantastic.",

When I told him how awkward he was making the situation he proceeded to tell me he needed that tip due to the fees they were charging went directly to the company and they did not receive any %.\n\nWhen we got to the new apartment they gave me a bill for 400$...for a 2 hour move! I was upset because the receptionist that booked me forgot to mention about $200 worth of extra fees. When I called the company to confirm this outrageous fee the unprofessional driver started throwing things! He was ranting about every customer arguing once they got to the new house and how he only gets 8$ an hour. That tells me that the people booking forget to mention these fees often. \n\nIt was an awful experience. Don't use this company.  The way they treat their employees creates a hostile environment.

However, we had put half the money down to get the prospect going. After weeks of waiting, he finally got back with us. We asked that he coordinate with our concrete man for proper elevations and grading. He did met with our concrete man, installed posts and we waited an additional 2 weeks to hear back from Paul about when the gates and fencing materials would be installed. He finally installed the gates and fencing. As you can see by the photo, the gates were uneven and cut wrong at the bottom. When I asked Paul why, he stated that is how it was supposed to look. Unacceptable. I had hi come back and attempt to hang the gates professionally. He managed to get the gates close to even, but then the bottom was all wrong. He came back a 3rd time and installed cheap track along the bottom to hide the cutting mistakes. By the way, he was to quote me additional gates (before how bad I knew B&B a Fencing was), but never got back to me with the quote. I texted Paul and asked where the quite was. He said he left the quote in the truck but would email me. I waited again, nothing. I followed up with him and this time he said he emailed it. He hadn't.

Both of us are first-timer at Flemings but really enjoyed our nights. \n\nReservation at 6:30 on a Saturday night in the private room section, a perfect seating for us as it was much quieter. Our dinner consisted a shared plate of calamari, two petite filet with a side of grilled asparagus and sauteed mushroom. \n\nCalamari plate was very big, pre-mixed with the hot n sour (though it says hot and sweet) sauce, not the typical calamari I had tried, especially there were sauteed red pepper, onions and some very sour jalapenos. Overall it was ok, the outside layer of calamari isn't as crispy as I wanted, probably because it was already mixed with sauce.\n\nNow to the main dish, steak!! We both opted for the petite size, it was perfect for us, very well accompanied by the grilled asparagus and sauteed mushrooms. My medium rare filet came out very nice and juicy. If only my mom doesn't eat her steak at well-done, i would have ordered a bigger steak to share (of course to save money too!) oh well, we both only want what we like :p\n\nFor dessert, we chose the famous lava cake. Well, it came out very neat looking with two scoops of ice cream and a little candle, but the cake itself was a bit too bitter for me, it was very very dark chocolate. I normally do like dark chocolate, but this lava cake, if no ice cream was accompanied, i don't know how many bites I could take.\n\n Our overall experience was great, very nice staff and attentive services!

But not sure where is this coming from since you didn't describe a bad experience or something wrong that one of our servers did with you. We know our regulars by name and by face. My main server has been here for over 10 years that works almost everyday. We appreciate all our guests whether you are a regular or not. If you choose to take your business somewhere that is your decision at the end of the day. Cheers! \n\nMy response: To go into the numerous times that my meals were delivered late, hosts barely acknowledging my party's existence in a mostly empty restaurant, the lack of customer service (I AM telling you) in addition to your apathetic response is exactly why you get one star. By acknowledgement I just mean a friendly hello and warm banter that makes people feel welcome. The service was good until the waitstaff had changed a while ago. There was one \"gentleman\" who had been there forever and he was obnoxiously rude. (Someone being a faithful employee doesn't translate to good service). \nI'm kindly stating that your service needs work. There are plenty of new restaurants and I haven't seen your restaurant full in a LOOOOONG time.",

The spicy baba ganoush was good but the overly salty chicken forced me to ask for a side of regular hummus to balance the flavor. It wasn't too bad but the fact that I paid over $10 for a medium sized lunch and a pathetic salad makes me not want to come back, even with the yelp check in offer.",

It wasn't busy, almost empty really, and servers could be seen chatting amongst themselves.\n\nI should have heeded that warning.\n\nBefore Mariko, I wouldn't have believed that sushi could be made and served so poorly. The rolls were mostly rice, falling apart from poor construction, actually lukewarm, and the fish (what there was of it) was definitely not fresh. The \"spicy sauce\" that covered some options seemed to be little more than a greasy spiced mayonnaise-like goop that I might expect to see at a roadside Denny's. \n\nA server dressed in dirty sweatpants? Dust-covered exposed wiring tangled around the tawdry lighting fixtures? \n\nNever again.",

The associate in the nuts and bolts section was currently busy assisting another customer, so I asked him to call someone to assist me. After 15 minutes of waiting I saw the same associate walk down the aisle I was in. When he saw me he turned around and walked away. When I finally did get someone's attention I was told there was no comparable replacement in stock. He didn't even try to size the bolt he just looked at it and said no. I left and went to another ace hardware on McDonald in mesa, and got exactly what I needed with no hassle.",

Wrong....apparently the place still has the newness factor and I drove around 10 minutes trying to find a parking space   I tried the valet parking across the street but they were full and I ended up driving around before settling on a space 3 blocks away.\n\nThankfully there were a couple of seats at the bar which I claimed one.  Looking around the place, I felt really old here. The place seems to cater to the younger crowd even at 8pm.  \n\nThe bar was busy. It was about 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged me.  Then I asked what their beers were and she explained them (little did I know that the menu she would hand me in a few minutes would contain a list of their beers).  Thankfully they have a bunch of craft beers on tap.  \n\nThe food menu is small and consists of apps (think chips with salsa, queso or guac), salads, tacos and such but your choices are limited for all of them.\n\nI went with the recommendation from another review of the queso with everything except chorizo for an app and 2 tacos rojas which were all vegetarian.  Another disappointment when both arrived at the same time.  The queso was mediocre at best.  It was very grainy and the extras of black beans and jalapenos were on top of a cheese crust rather than mixed in the queso.\n\nThe tacos were decent but nothing i would consider better than average.\n\nService is what caused this to be a 2 star review rather than a 3. Although there were 3 bartenders, only one seemed to be 'my' bartender but she disappeared and I didn't see her after one \"Are you ok here\".   Another bartender asked me if I wanted another beer but that was it...at that point I was ready to close my bill.  The 3rd one asked again if I needed another beer and I stated I was done and finally I received a check. Unfortunately at the time it was too late to make up for the other mistakes.\n\nSo if you like trendy places in trendy neighborhoods with limited parking, perhaps you would enjoy this one. But honestly, my other choice when i chose to stop here was Moe's down the street. After spending some time at Bakersfield, I wish I would have chose Moe's.  \n\nThis place seems to be popular with some of the locals but if you check their website, it appears they are yet another chain with their other locations in the midwest.  In order to survive here they need to be open to people over 40, improve their bar service and make their restaurant a destination where people will walk for  blocks to get there.  I cannot see myself coming back here until something changes.",
